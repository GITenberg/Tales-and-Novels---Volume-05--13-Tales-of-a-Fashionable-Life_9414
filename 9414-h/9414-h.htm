    <p>
      NOTE FROM MRS. BEAUMONT TO MISS WALSINGHAM.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am more grieved than I can express, my dearest Miss Walsingham, by a
      cruel <i>contre-temps</i>, which must prevent my indulging myself in the
      long-promised and long-expected pleasure of being at your <i>fête de
      famille</i> on Tuesday, to celebrate your dear father's birthday. I trust,
      however, to your conciliating goodness, my kind young friend, to represent
      my distress properly to Mr. Walsingham. Make him sensible, I conjure you,
      that my <i>heart</i> is with you all, and assure him that this is no
      common apology. Indeed, I never employ such artifices with my friends: to
      them, and to you in particular, my dear, I always speak with perfect
      frankness and candour. Amelia, with whom, <i>entre nous</i>, you are more
      a favourite than ever, is so much vexed and mortified by this
      disappointment, that I see I shall not be restored to favour till I can
      fix a day for going to you: yet when that may be, circumstances, which I
      should not feel myself quite justified in mentioning, will not permit me
      to decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kindest regards and affectionate remembrances to all your dear circle.&mdash;Any
      news of the young captain? Any hopes of his return from sea?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ever with perfect truth, my dearest Miss Walsingham's sincere friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      "EUGENIA BEAUMONT.
    </p>
    <p>
      "P.S.&mdash;Private&mdash;read to yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be candid with you, my dear young friend, my secret reason for denying
      myself the pleasure of Tuesday's fête is, that I have just heard that
      there is a shocking chicken-pox in the village near you; and I confess it
      is one of my weaknesses to dread even the bare rumour of such a thing, on
      account of my Amelia: but I should not wish to have this mentioned in your
      house, because you must be sensible your father would think it an idle
      womanish fear; and you know how anxious I am for his esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Burn this, I beseech you&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon second thoughts, I believe it will be best to tell the truth, and
      the whole truth, to your father, if you should see that nothing else will
      do&mdash;&mdash;In short, I write in haste, and must trust now, as ever,
      entirely to your discretion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear," said Mr. Walsingham to his daughter, as the young lady
      sat at the breakfast table looking over this note, "how long do you mean
      to sit the picture of The Delicate Embarrassment? To relieve you as far as
      in me lies, let me assure you that I shall not ask to see this note of
      Mrs. Beaumont's, which as usual seems to contain some mighty mystery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No great mystery; only&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only&mdash;some minikin mystery?" said Mr. Walsingham. "Yes, '<i>Elle est
      politique pour des choux et des raves</i>.'&mdash;This charming widow
      Beaumont is <i>manoeuvrer</i>.<a href="#linknote-1" name="linknoteref-1"
      id="linknoteref-1"><small>1</small></a> We can't well make an English word
      of it. The species, thank Heaven! is not so numerous yet in England as to
      require a generic name. The description, however, has been touched by one
      of our poets:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'Julia's a manager: she's born for rule,
     And knows her wiser husband is a fool.
     For her own breakfast she'll project a scheme,
     Nor take her tea without a stratagem.'
</pre>
    <p>
      Even from the time when Mrs. Beaumont was a girl of sixteen I remember her
      manoeuvring to gain a husband, and then manoeuvring to manage him, which
      she did with triumphant address."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort of a man was Colonel Beaumont?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An excellent man; an open-hearted soldier, of the strictest honour and
      integrity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then is it not much in Mrs. Beaumont's favour, that she enjoyed the
      confidence of such a man, and that he left her guardian to his son and
      daughter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he had lived with her long enough to become acquainted with her real
      character, what you say, my dear, would be unanswerable. But Colonel
      Beaumont died a few years after his marriage, and during those few years
      he was chiefly with his regiment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will, however, allow," said Miss Walsingham, "that since his death
      Mrs. Beaumont has justified his confidence.&mdash;Has she not been a good
      guardian, and an affectionate mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why&mdash;as a guardian, I think she has allowed her son too much
      liberty, and too much money. I have heard that young Beaumont has lost a
      considerable sum at Newmarket, I grant you that Mrs. Beaumont is an
      affectionate mother, and I am convinced that she is extremely anxious to
      advance the worldly interests of her children; still I cannot, my dear,
      agree with you, that she is a good mother. In the whole course of the
      education of her son and daughter, she has pursued a system of artifice.
      Whatever she wanted them to learn, or to do, or to leave undone, some
      stratagem, sentimental or scenic, was employed; somebody was to hint to
      some other body to act upon Amelia to make her do so and so. Nothing&mdash;that
      is, nothing like truth, ever came directly from the mother: there were
      always whisperings and mysteries, and 'Don't say that before Amelia!' and
      'I would not have this told to Edward,' because it might make him like
      something that she did not wish that he should like, and that she had <i>her
      reasons</i> for not letting him know that she did not wish him to like.
      There was always some truth to be concealed for some mighty good purpose;
      and things and persons were to be represented in false lights, to produce
      on some particular occasion some partial effect. All this succeeded
      admirably in detail, and for the management of helpless, ignorant,
      credulous childhood. But mark the consequences of this system: children
      grow up, and cannot always see, hear, and understand, just as their
      mothers please. They will go into the world; they will mix with others;
      their eyes will be opened; they will see through the whole system of
      artifice by which their childhood was so cleverly managed; and then,
      confidence in the parent must be destroyed for ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Walsingham acknowledged the truth of what her father said; but she
      observed that this was a common error in education, which had the sanction
      of high authority in its favour; even the eloquent Rousseau, and the
      elegant and ingenious Madame de Genlis. "And it is certain," continued
      Miss Walsingham, "that Mrs. Beaumont has not made her children artful;
      both Amelia and Mr. Beaumont are remarkably open, sincere, honourable
      characters. Mr. Beaumont, indeed, carries his sincerity almost to a fault:
      he is too blunt, perhaps, in his manner;&mdash;and Amelia, though she is
      of such a timid, gentle temper, and so much afraid of giving pain, has
      always courage enough to speak the truth, even in circumstances where it
      is most difficult. So at least you must allow, my dear father, that Mrs.
      Beaumont has made her children sincere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry, my dear, to seem uncharitable; but I must observe, that
      sometimes the very faults of parents produce a tendency to opposite
      virtues in their children: for the children suffer by the consequences of
      these faults, and detecting, despise, and resolve to avoid them. As to
      Amelia and Mr. Beaumont, their acquaintance with our family has been no
      unfavourable circumstance in their education. They saw amongst us the
      advantages of sincerity: they became attached to you, and to my excellent
      ward Captain Walsingham; he obtained strong power over young Beaumont's
      mind, and used it to the best purposes. Your friendship for Amelia was, I
      think, equally advantageous to her: as you are nearly of the same age, you
      had opportunities of winning her confidence; and your stronger mind
      fortified hers, and inspired her timid character with the courage
      necessary to be sincere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," persisted Miss Walsingham, "though Mrs. Beaumont may have used a
      little <i>finesse</i> towards her children in trifles, yet in matters of
      consequence, I do think that she has no interest but theirs; and her
      affection for them will make her lay aside all art, when their happiness
      is at stake."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Walsingham shook his head.&mdash;"And do you then really believe, my
      dear Marianne, that Mrs. Beaumont would consider any thing, for instance,
      in the marriage of her son and daughter, but fortune, and what the world
      calls <i>connexion and establishments</i>?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly I cannot think that these are Mrs. Beaumont's first objects;
      because we are people but of small fortune, and yet she prefers us to many
      of large estates and higher station."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should say, she professes to prefer us," replied Mr. Walsingham. "And
      do you really believe her to be sincere? Now, there is my ward, Captain
      Walsingham, for whom she pretends to have such a regard, do you think that
      Mrs. Beaumont wishes her daughter should marry him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, indeed; but Mrs. Beaumont must speak cautiously on that subject;
      this is prudence, not dissimulation: for you know that my cousin
      Walsingham never declared his attachment to Miss Beaumont; on the
      contrary, he always took the most scrupulous pains to conceal it from her,
      because he had not fortune enough to marry, and he was too honourable to
      attempt, or even to wish, to engage the affections of one to whom he had
      no prospect of being united."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is a noble fellow!" exclaimed Mr. Walsingham. "There is no sacrifice
      of pleasure or interest he would hesitate to make to his duty. For his
      friends there is no exertion, no endurance, no forbearance, of which he
      has not shown himself capable. For his country&mdash;&mdash;All I ask from
      Heaven for him is, opportunity to serve his country. Whether
      circumstances, whether success, will ever prove his merits to the world, I
      cannot foretell; but I shall always glory in him as my ward, my relation,
      my friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Beaumont speaks of him just as you do," said Miss Walsingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speaks, but not thinks," said Mr. Walsingham. "No, no! Captain Walsingham
      is not the man she desires for a son-in-law. She wants to marry Amelia to
      Sir John Hunter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Sir John Hunter!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, to Sir John Hunter, a being without literature, without morals,
      without even youth, to plead in his favour. He is nearly forty years old,
      old enough to be Amelia's father; yet this is the man whom Mrs. Beaumont
      prefers for the husband of her beloved daughter, because he is heir
      presumptive to a great estate, and has the chance of a reversionary
      earldom.&mdash;And this is your modern good mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, no!" cried Miss Walsingham, "you do Mrs. Beaumont injustice; I
      assure you she despises Sir John Hunter as much as we do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet observe the court she has paid to the whole family of the Hunters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but that has been merely from regard to the late Lady Hunter, who
      was her particular friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Particular friend!</i> a vamped-up, sentimental conversation reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I assure you," persisted Miss Walsingham, "that I know Mrs.
      Beaumont's mind better than you do, father, at least on this subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You! a girl of eighteen, pretend to know a manoeuvrer of her age!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only let me tell you my reasons.&mdash;It was but last week that Mrs.
      Beaumont told me that she did not wish to encourage Sir John Hunter, and
      that she should be perfectly happy if she could see Amelia united to such
      a man as Captain Walsingham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a man as Captain Walsingham! nicely guarded expression!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you have not heard all yet.&mdash;Mrs. Beaumont anxiously inquired
      from me whether he had made any prize-money, whether there was any chance
      of his returning soon; and she added, with particular emphasis, 'You don't
      know how much I wish it! You don't know what a favourite he is of mine!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That last, I will lay any wager," cried Mr. Walsingham, "she said in a
      whisper, and in a corner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but she could not do otherwise, for Amelia was present. Mrs.
      Beaumont took me aside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aside; ay, ay, but take care, I advise you, of her <i>asides</i>, and her
      whisperings, and her cornerings, and her inuendoes, and semiconfidences,
      lest your own happiness, my dear, unsuspecting, enthusiastic daughter,
      should be the sacrifice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Walsingham now stood perfectly silent, in embarrassed and breathless
      anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," continued her father, "that Mrs. Beaumont, for whose mighty
      genius one intrigue at a time is not sufficient, wants also to persuade
      you, my dear, that she wishes to have you for a daughter-in-law: and yet
      all the time she is doing every thing she can to make her son marry that
      fool, Miss Hunter, merely because she has two hundred thousand pounds
      fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There I can assure you that you are mistaken," said Miss Walsingham;
      "Mrs. Beaumont dreads that her son should marry Miss Hunter. Mrs. Beaumont
      thinks her as silly as you do, and complained to me of her having no taste
      for literature, or for any thing, but dress, and trifling conversation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder, then, that Mrs. Beaumont selects her continually for her
      companion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She thinks Miss Hunter the most insipid companion in the world; but I
      dare not tell you, lest you should laugh at me again, that it was for the
      sake of the late Lady Hunter that Mrs. Beaumont was so kind to the
      daughter; and now Miss Hunter is so fond of her, and so grateful, that, as
      Mrs. Beaumont says, it would be cruelty to shake her off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mighty plausible! But the truth of all this, begging Mrs. Beaumont's
      pardon, I doubt; I will not call it a falsehood, but I may be permitted to
      call it a <i>Beaumont</i>. Time will show: and in the mean time, my dear
      daughter, be on your guard against Mrs. Beaumont's art, and against your
      own credulity. The momentary pain I give my friends by speaking the plain
      truth, I have always found overbalanced by the pleasure and advantage of
      mutual confidence. Our domestic happiness has arisen chiefly from our
      habits of openness and sincerity. Our whole souls are laid open; there is
      no management, no '<i>intrigue de cabinet</i>, no '<i>esprit de la ligue</i>.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Walsingham now left the room; and Miss Walsingham, absorbed in
      reflections more interesting to her than even the defence of Mrs.
      Beaumont, went out to walk. Her father's house was situated in a beautiful
      part of Devonshire, near the sea-shore, in the neighbourhood of Plymouth;
      and as Miss Walsingham was walking on the beach, she saw an old fisherman
      mooring his boat to the projecting stump of a tree. His figure was so
      picturesque, that she stopped to sketch it; and as she was drawing, a
      woman came from the cottage near the shore to ask the fisherman what luck
      he had had. "A fine turbot," says he, "and a john-doree."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then away with them this minute to Beaumont Park," said the woman; "for
      here's Madam Beaumont's man, Martin, called <i>in a flustrum</i> while you
      was away, to say madam must have the nicest of our fish, whatsomever it
      might be, and a john-doree, if it could be had for love or money, for
      Tuesday."&mdash;Here the woman, perceiving Miss Walsingham, dropped a
      curtsy. "Your humble servant, Miss Walsingham," said the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On Tuesday?" said Miss Walsingham: "are you sure that Mrs. Beaumont
      bespoke the fish for Tuesday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, <i>sartin</i> sure, miss; for Martin mentioned, moreover, what he had
      heard talk in the servants' hall, that there is to be a very <i>pettiklar</i>
      old gentleman, as rich! as rich! as rich can be! from foreign parts, and a
      great friend of the colonel that's dead; and he&mdash;that is, the old <i>pettiklar</i>
      gentleman&mdash;is to be down all the way from Lon'on to dine at the park
      on Tuesday for <i>sartin</i>: so, husband, away with the john-doree and
      the turbot, while they be fresh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why," thought Miss Walsingham, "did not Mrs. Beaumont tell us the
      plain truth, if this is the truth?"
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Young Hermes next, a close contriving god, Her brows encircled with his
      serpent rod; Then plots and fair excuses fill her brain, And views of
      breaking am'rous vows for gain."
    </p>
    <p>
      The information which Mrs. Beaumont's man, Martin, had learned from the
      servants' hall, and had communicated to the fisherman's wife, was more
      correct, and had been less amplified, embellished, misunderstood, or
      misrepresented, than is usually found to be the case with pieces of news
      which are so heard and so repeated. It was true that Mrs. Beaumont
      expected to see on Tuesday an old gentleman, a Mr. Palmer, who had been a
      friend of her husband's; he had lately returned from Jamaica, where he had
      made a large fortune. It is true, also, that this old gentleman was <i>a
      little particular</i>, but not precisely in the sense in which the
      fisherman's wife understood the phrase; he was not particularly fond of
      john-dorees and turbots, but he was particularly fond of making his
      fellow-creatures happy; particularly generous, particularly open and
      honest in his nature, abhorring all artifice himself, and unsuspicious of
      it in others. He was unacquainted with Mrs. Beaumont's character, as he
      had been for many years in the West Indies, and he knew her only from her
      letters, in which she appeared every thing that was candid and amiable.
      His great friendship for her deceased husband also inclined him to like
      her. Colonel Beaumont had appointed him one of the guardians of his
      children, but Mr. Palmer, being absent from England, had declined to act:
      he was also trustee to Mrs. Beaumont's marriage-settlement, and she had
      represented that it was necessary he should be present at the settlement
      of her family affairs upon her son's coming of age; an event which was to
      take place in a few days. The urgent representations of Mrs. Beaumont, and
      the anxious desire she expressed to see Mr. Palmer, had at last prevailed
      with the good old gentleman to journey down to Beaumont Park, though he
      was a valetudinarian, and though he was obliged, he said, to return to
      Jamaica with the West India fleet, which was expected to sail in ten days;
      so that he announced positively that he could stay but a week at Beaumont
      Park with his good friends and relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was related but distantly to the Beaumonts, and he stood in precisely
      the same degree of relationship to the Walsinghams. He had no other
      relations, and his fortune was completely at his own disposal. On this
      fortune our cunning widow had speculated long and deeply, though in fact
      there was no occasion for art: it was Mr. Palmer's intention to leave his
      large fortune to the Beaumonts; or to divide it between the Beaumont and
      Walsingham families; and had she been sincere in her professed desire of a
      complete union by a double marriage between the representatives of the
      families, her favourite object would have been, in either case, equally
      secure. Here was a plain, easy road to her object; but it was too direct
      for Mrs. Beaumont. With all her abilities, she could never comprehend the
      axiom that a right line is the shortest possible line between any two
      points:&mdash;an axiom equally true in morals and in mathematics. No, the
      serpentine line was, in her opinion, not only the most beautiful, but the
      most expeditious, safe, and convenient.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had formed a triple scheme of such intricacy, that it is necessary
      distinctly to state the argument of her plot, lest the action should be
      too complicated to be easily developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had, in the first place, a design of engrossing the whole of Mr.
      Palmer's fortune for her own family; and for this purpose she determined
      to prevent Mr. Palmer from becoming acquainted with his other relations,
      the Walsinghams, to whom she had always had a secret dislike, because they
      were of remarkably open, sincere characters. As Mr. Palmer proposed to
      stay but a week in the country, this scheme of preventing their meeting
      seemed feasible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second place, Mrs. Beaumont wished to marry her daughter to Sir
      John Hunter, because Sir John was heir expectant to a large estate, called
      the Wigram estate, and because there was in his family a certain
      reversionary title, the earldom of Puckeridge, which would devolve to Sir
      John after the death of a near relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the third place, Mrs. Beaumont wished to marry her own son to Miss
      Hunter, who was Sir John's sister by a second marriage, and above twenty
      years younger than he was: this lady was preferred to Miss Walsingham for
      a daughter-in-law, for the reasons which Mr. Walsingham had given; because
      she possessed an independent fortune of two hundred thousand pounds, and
      because she was so childish and silly that Mrs. Beaumont thought she could
      always manage her easily, and by this means retain power over her son.
      Miss Hunter was very pretty, and Mrs. Beaumont had observed that her son
      had sometimes been struck with her beauty sufficiently to give hopes that,
      by proper management, he might be diverted from his serious, sober
      preference of Miss Walsingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont foresaw many difficulties in the execution of these plans.
      She knew that Amelia liked Captain Walsingham, and that Captain Walsingham
      was attached to her, though he had never declared his love: and she
      dreaded that Captain Walsingham, who was at this time at sea, should
      return, just whilst Mr. Palmer was with her; because she was well aware
      that the captain was a kind of man Mr. Palmer would infinitely prefer to
      Sir John Hunter. Indeed, she had been secretly informed that Mr. Palmer
      hated every one who had a title; therefore she could not, whilst he was
      with her, openly encourage Sir John Hunter in his addresses to Amelia. To
      conciliate these seemingly incompatible schemes, she determined&mdash;&mdash;But
      let our heroine speak for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dearest Miss Hunter," said she, "now we are by ourselves, let me open
      my mind to you; I have been watching for an opportunity these two days,
      but so hurried as I have been!&mdash;Where's Amelia?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out walking, ma'am. She told me you begged her to walk to get rid of her
      head-ache; and that she might look well to-day, as Mr. Palmer is to come.
      I would not go with her, because you whispered to me at breakfast that you
      had something very particular to say to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you did not give <i>that</i> as a reason, I hope! Surely you didn't
      tell Amelia that I had something particular to say to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, ma'am; I told her that I had something to do about my dress&mdash;and
      so I had&mdash;my new hat to try on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, my love; quite right; for you know I wouldn't have her suspect that
      we had any thing to say to each other that we didn't wish her to hear,
      especially as it is about herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herself!&mdash;Oh, is it?" said Miss Hunter, in a tone of disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And about you, too, my darling. Be assured I have no daughter I love
      better, or ever shall. With such a son as I have, and such a
      daughter-in-law as I hope and trust I shall have ere long, I shall think
      myself the most fortunate of mothers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Silly Miss Hunter's face brightened up again. "But now, my love,"
      continued Mrs. Beaumont, taking her hand, leading her to a window, and
      speaking very low, though no one else was in the room, "before we talk any
      more of what is nearest my heart, I must get you to write a note for me to
      your brother, directly, for there is a circumstance I forgot&mdash;thoughtless
      creature that I am! but indeed, I never can <i>think</i> when I <i>feel</i>
      much. Some people are always so collected and prudent. But I have none of
      that!&mdash;Heigho! Well, my dear, you must supply my deficiencies. You
      will write and tell Sir John, that in my agitation when he made his
      proposal for my Amelia, of which I so frankly approved, I omitted to warn
      him, that no hint must be given that I do any thing more than permit him
      to address my daughter upon an equal footing with any other gentleman who
      might address her. Stay, my dear; you don't understand me, I see. In
      short, to be candid with you&mdash;old Mr. Palmer is coming to-day, you
      know. Now, my dear, you must be aware that it is of the greatest
      consequence to the interests of my family, of which I hope you always
      consider yourself (for I have always considered you) as forming a part,
      and a very distinguished part&mdash;I say, my darling, that we must
      consider that it is our interest in all things to please and humour this
      good old gentleman. He will be with us but for a week, you know. Well, the
      point is this. I have been informed from undoubted authority, people who
      were about him at the time, and knew, that the reason he quarrelled with
      that nephew of his, who died two years ago, was the young man's having
      accepted a baronetage: and at that time old Palmer swore, that <i>no sprig
      of quality</i>&mdash;those were the very words&mdash;should ever inherit a
      shilling of his money. Such a ridiculous whim! But these London merchants,
      who make great fortunes from nothing, are apt to have their little
      eccentricities; and then, they have so much pride in their own way, and so
      much self-will and mercantile downrightness in their manners, that there's
      no managing them but by humouring their fancies. I'm convinced, if Mr.
      Palmer suspected that I even wished Amelia to marry Sir John, he would
      never leave any of us a farthing, and it would all go to the Walsinghams.
      So, my dear, do you explain to your brother, that though I have not the
      least objection to his coming here whilst Mr. Palmer is with us, he must
      not take umbrage at any seeming coldness in my manner. He knows my heart,
      I trust; at least, you do, my Albina. And even if I should be obliged to
      receive or to go to see the Walsinghams, which, by-the-bye, I have taken
      means to prevent; but if it should happen that they were to hear of
      Palmer's being with us, and come, and Sir John should meet them, he must
      not be surprised or jealous at my speaking in the highest terms of Captain
      Walsingham. This I shall be obliged to do as a blind before Mr. Palmer. I
      must make him believe that I prefer a commoner for my son-in-law, or we
      are all undone with him. You know it is my son's interest, and yours, as
      well as your brother's and Amelia's, that I consider. So explain all this
      to him, my dear; you will explain it so much better, and make it so much
      more palpable to your brother than I could."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Mrs. Beaumont, how can you think so? You who write so well, and such
      long letters about every thing, and so quick! But goodness! I shall never
      get it all into a letter I'm afraid, and before Mr. Palmer comes, and then
      it will soon be dressing-time! La! I could say it all to John in five
      minutes: what a pity he is not here to-day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my love, then suppose you were to go to him; as you so prudently
      remark, things of this sort are always so much easier and better said than
      written. And now I look at my watch, I see you cannot have time to write a
      long letter, and to dress. So I believe, though I shall grieve to lose
      you, I must consent to your going for this one day to your brother's. My
      carriage and Williamson shall attend you," said Mrs. Beaumont, ringing the
      bell to order the carriage; "but remember you promise me now to come back,
      positively, to-morrow, or next day at farthest, if I should not be able to
      send the carriage again to-morrow. I would not, upon any account, have you
      away, if it can possibly be helped, whilst Mr. Palmer is here, considering
      you as I do [The carriage to the door directly, and Williamson to attend
      Miss Hunter]&mdash;considering you as I do, my dearest Albina, quite as my
      own daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dearest Mrs. Beaumont, you are so kind!" said the poor girl, whom
      Mrs. Beaumont could always thus easily <i>pay with words</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage came to the door with such prompt obedience to Mrs.
      Beaumont's summons, that one of a more reflecting or calculating nature
      than Miss Hunter might have suspected that it had been ordered to be in
      readiness to carry her away this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fare ye well, my own Albina! be sure you don't stay long from us," said
      Mrs. Beaumont, accompanying her to the hall-door. "A thousand kind things
      to everybody, and your brother in particular. But, my dear Miss Hunter,
      one word more," said she, following to the carriage door, and whispering:
      "there's another thing that I must trust to your management and
      cleverness;&mdash;I mentioned that Mr. Palmer was to know nothing of <i>the
      approbation</i> of Sir John's suit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, yes, ma'am, I understand perfectly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But stay, my love; you must understand, too, that it is to be quite a
      secret between ourselves, not to be mentioned to my son even; for you know
      he is sudden in his temper, and warm and quite in the Walsingham interest,
      and there's no knowing what might be the consequence if it were to be let
      out imprudently, and Sir John and Edward both so high-spirited. One can't
      be too cautious, my dear, to prevent mischief between gentlemen. So
      caution your brother to leave it to me to break it, and bring things about
      with Edward and Amelia,"&mdash;[stopping Miss Hunter again as she made a
      second effort to get into the carriage,]&mdash;"You comprehend, my dear,
      that Amelia is not in the secret yet&mdash;so not a word from your brother
      to her about <i>my approbation!</i>&mdash;that would ruin all. I trust to
      his honour; and besides&mdash;" drawing the young lady back for the third
      whisper.&mdash;Miss Hunter stood suspended with one foot in air, and the
      other on the step; the coachman, impatient to be off, manoeuvred to make
      his horses restless, whilst at the same time he cried aloud&mdash;"So! so!
      Prancer&mdash;stand still, Peacock; stand still, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hunter jumped down on terra firma. "Those horses frighten me so for
      you, my dear!" said Mrs. Beaumont. "Martin, stand at their heads. My dear
      child, I won't detain you, for you'll be late. I had only to say, that&mdash;oh!
      that I trust implicitly to your brother's honour; but, besides this, it
      will not be amiss for you to hint, as you know you can delicately&mdash;<i>delicately</i>,
      you understand&mdash;that it is for his interest to leave me to manage
      every thing. Yet none of this is to be said <i>as if from me</i>&mdash;pray
      don't let it come from me. Say it all from yourself. Don't let my name be
      mentioned at all. Don't commit me, you understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly, perfectly, ma'am: one kiss, dear Mrs. Beaumont, and adieu. Is
      my dressing-box in? Tell him to drive fast, for I hate going slow. Dearest
      Mrs. Beaumont, good bye. I feel as if I were going for an age, though it
      is only for one day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, affectionate girl! I love <i>heart</i>&mdash;Good bye&mdash;Drive
      fast, as Miss Hunter desires you."

      Our fair politician, well satisfied with the understanding of her

      Mr. Beaumont had just been at a neighbouring farm-house, where there lived
      one of Mr. Walsingham's tenants; a man of the name of Birch, a respectable
      farmer, who was originally from Ireland, and whose son was at sea with
      Captain Walsingham. The captain had taken young Birch under his particular
      care, at Mr. Walsingham's request.
    </p>
    <p>
      Birch's parents had this day received a letter from their son, which in
      the joy and pride of their hearts they showed to Mr. Beaumont, who was in
      the habit of calling at their house to inquire if they had heard any news
      of their son, or of Captain Walsingham. Mr. Beaumont liked to read Birch's
      letters, because they were written with characteristic simplicity and
      affection, and somewhat in the Irish idiom, which this young sailor's
      English education had not made him entirely forget.

      LETTER FROM BIRCH TO HIS PARENTS.
    </p>
    <p>
      "H.M.S. l'Ambuscade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "HONOURED PARENTS,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I write this from sea, lat. N. 44.15&mdash;long. W. 9.45&mdash;wind
      N.N.E.&mdash;to let you know you will not see me so soon as I said in my
      last, of the 16th. Yesterday, P.M. two o'clock, some despatches were
      brought to my good captain, by the Pickle sloop, which will to-morrow,
      wind and weather permitting, alter our destination. What the nature of
      them is I cannot impart to you, for it has not transpired beyond the
      lieutenants; but whatever I do under the orders of my good captain, I am
      satisfied and confident all is for the best. For my own share, I long for
      an opportunity of fighting the French, and of showing the captain <i>what
      is in me</i>, and that the pains he has took to make a gentleman, and an
      honour to his majesty's service, of me, is not thrown away. Had he been my
      own father, or brother, he could not be better, or <i>done more</i>. God
      willing, I will never disgrace his principles, for it would be my ambition
      to be like him in every respect; and he says, if I behave myself as I
      ought, I shall soon be a lieutenant; and a lieutenant in his majesty's
      navy is as good a gentleman as any in England, and has a right (tell my
      sister Kitty) to hand the first woman in Lon'on out of her carriage, if he
      pleases, and if she pleases.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now we talk of ladies, and as please God we shall soon be in action, and
      may not have another opportunity of writing to you this great while, for
      there is talk of our sailing southward with the fleet to bring the French
      and Spaniards to action, I think it best to send you all the news I have
      in this letter. But pray bid Kate, with my love, mind this, that not a
      word of the following is to take wind for her life, on account of my not
      knowing if it might be agreeable, or how it might affect my good captain,
      and others that shall be nameless. You must know then that when we were at
      &mdash;&mdash;, where we were stationed six weeks and two days, waiting
      for the winds, and one cause or other, we used to employ ourselves, I and
      my captain, taking soundings (which I can't more particularly explain the
      nature of to you, especially in a letter); for he always took me out to
      attend him in preference to any other; and after he had completed his
      soundings, and had no farther use for me in that job, I asked him leave to
      go near the same place in the evening to fish, which my good captain
      consented to (as he always does to what (duty done) can gratify me),
      provided I was in my ship by ten. Now you must know that there are
      convents in this country (which you have often heard of, Kitty, no doubt),
      being damnable places, where young <i>Catholic</i> women are shut up
      unmarried, often, it is to be reasonably supposed, against their wills.
      And there is a convent in one of the suburbs which has a high back wall to
      the garden of it that comes down near the strand; and it was under this
      wall we two used to sound, and that afterwards I used to be fishing. And
      one evening, when I was not thinking of any such thing, there comes over
      the wall a huge nosegay of flowers, with a stone in it, that made me jump.
      And this for three evenings running the same way, about the same hour;
      till at last one evening as I was looking up at the wall, as I had now
      learned to do about the time the nosegays were thrown over, I saw coming
      down a stone tied to a string, and to the stone a letter, the words of
      which I can't particularly take upon me to recollect, because I gave up
      the paper to my captain, who desired it of me, and took no copy; but the
      sense was, that in that convent there was shut up a lady, the daughter of
      an English gentleman by a Spanish wife, both her parents being dead, and
      her Spanish relations and father-confessor (or catholic priest of a man),
      not wishing she should get to England, where she might be what she had a
      right to be by birth, at least by her father's side (a <i>protestant</i>),
      shut her up since she was a child. And that there was a relative of hers
      in England, who with a wicked lawyer or attorney had got possession of her
      estate, and made every body believe she was dead. And so, it being seven
      years and more since she was heard of, she is what is called dead in law,
      which sort of death however won't signify, if she appears again. Wherefore
      the letter goes on to say, she would be particularly glad to make her
      escape, and get over to old England. But she confesses that she is neither
      young nor handsome, and may-be never may be rich; therefore, that whoever
      helps her must do it for the sake of doing good and nothing else; for
      though she would pay all expenses handsomely, she could not promise more.
      And that she knew the danger of the undertaking to be great; greater for
      them that would carry her off even than for herself. That she knows,
      however, that British sailors are brave as they are generous (this part of
      the letter was very well indited, and went straight to my heart the minute
      ever I read it); and she wished it could be in the power of Captain
      Walsingham to take her under his immediate protection, and that she had
      taken measures so as she could escape over the wall of the garden if he
      would have a boat in readiness to carry her to his ship; and at the same
      hour next evening the stone should be let down as usual, and he might
      fasten his answer to it, which would be drawn up in due course. Concluding
      all this with, 'That she would not go at all unless Captain Walsingham
      came for her himself (certifying himself to be himself, I suppose), for
      she knew him to be a gentleman by reputation, and she should be safe under
      his protection, and so would her secret, she was confident, at all
      events.' This was the entire and sum total of the letter. So when I had
      read to the end, and looked for the postscript and all, I found for my
      pains that the lady mistook me for my captain, or would not have written
      or thrown the nosegays. So I took the letter to my captain; and what he
      answered, and how it was settled (by signals, I suppose) between them
      after, it was not for me to inquire. Not a word more was said by him to me
      or I to him on the topic, till the very night we were to sail for England.
      It was then that our captain took me aside, and he says, 'Birch, will you
      assist me? I ask this not as your captain, so you are at liberty to do as
      you please. Will you help me to rescue this lady, who seems to be unjustly
      detained, and to carry her back safe to her country and her friends?' I
      told him I would do that or any thing else he bid me, confident he would
      never ask me to do a wrong thing; and as to the lady, I should be proud to
      help to carry her off to old England and her lawful friends, only I
      thought (if I might be so bold) it was a pity she was not young and
      handsome, for his sake. At that he smiled, and only said, 'Perhaps it was
      best for him as it was.' Then he settled about the boat, and who were to
      go, and when. It was twelve o'clock striking by the great town clock when
      we were under the walls of the convent, as appointed. And all was hush and
      silent as the grave for our very lives. For it was a matter of life or
      death, I promise you, and we all knew as much, and the sailors had a dread
      of the Inquisition upon them that was beyond all terrible! So we watched
      and waited, and waited and watched so long, that we thought something must
      have gone wrong, or that all was found out, and the captain could not
      delay the ship's sailing; and he struck his repeater, and it was within a
      quarter of one, and he said, 'It is too late; we must put back.' Just
      then, I, that was watching with the lantern in my hand, gave notice, and
      first there comes down a white bundle, fastened to the stone and cord.
      Then the captain and I fixed the ladder of ropes, and down came the lady,
      as well as ever she went up, and not a word but away with her: the captain
      had her in a trice in our boat, safe and snug, and off we put, rowing for
      the bare life, all silent as ever. I think I hear the striking of our oars
      and the plashing of the water this minute, which we would have gladly
      silenced, but could not any way in nature. But none heard it, or at least
      took any notice against us. I can give you no idea of the terror which the
      lady manifested when the boat stood out to sea, at the slightest squall of
      wind, or the least agitation of the waves; for besides being naturally
      cowardly, as all or most women are for the first time at sea, here was a
      poor soul who had been watching, and may be fasting, and worn out mind and
      body with the terror of perfecting her escape from the convent, where she
      had been immured all her life, and as helpless as a child. So it was
      wonderful she went through it as well as she did and without screaming,
      which should be an example to Kate and others. Glad enough even we men
      were when we reached the ship. There was, at that time, a silence on board
      you could have heard a pin drop, all being in perfect readiness for
      getting under way, the sails ready for dropping, and officers and sailors
      waiting in the greatest expectation of our boat's return. Our boat passed
      swiftly alongside, and great beyond belief was the astonishment of all at
      seeing a woman veiled, hoisted out, and in, and ushered below, half
      fainting. I never felt more comfortable in my life than when we found her
      and ourselves safe aboard l'Ambuscade. The anchor was instantly weighed,
      all sail made, and the ship stood out to sea. To the lady the captain gave
      up his cabin: double sentries were placed, and as the captain ordered,
      every precaution that could shield her character in such suspicious
      circumstances were enforced with the utmost punctilio. I cannot describe,
      nor can you even conceive, Kate, the degree of curiosity shown about her;
      all striving to get a sight of her when she first went down, and most
      zealous they were to bring lights; but that would not do, for they could
      not see her for her veil. Yet through all we could make out that she was a
      fine figure of a woman at any rate, and something more than ordinary, from
      the air she had with her. The next day when she was sitting on deck the
      wind by times would blow aside her veil so as to give us glimpses of her
      face; when, to our surprise, and I am sure to the captain's satisfaction,
      we found she was beyond all contradiction young and handsome. And moreover
      I have reason to believe she has fine jewels with her, besides a ring from
      her own finger, which with a very pretty action she put on his, that next
      day on deck, as I noticed, when nobody was minding. So that no doubt she
      is as much richer as she is handsomer than she made believe, contrary to
      the ways of other women, which is in her favour and my good captain's; for
      from what I can judge, after all he has done for her, she has no dislike
      nor objection to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not time to add any thing more, but my love to Kitty, and Nancy,
      and Tom, and Mary, and little Bess; and, honoured parents, wishing you
      good health as I am in, thank God, at this present,

      in high spirits, as there is hopes of meeting the French and Spaniards. We

      and this letter safe to England."

      Mr. Beaumont might perhaps have been amused by this romantic story, and by
      the style in which it was told, if he had not been alarmed by the hint at
      the conclusion of the letter, that the lady was not indifferent to her
      deliverer. Now Mr. Beaumont earnestly wished that his friend Captain
      Walsingham might become his brother-in-law; and he began to have fears
      about this Spanish lady, with her gratitude, her rings, and the advantages
      of the great interest her misfortunes and helpless condition would excite,
      together with the vast temptations to fall in love that might occur during
      the course of a voyage. Had he taken notice of the postscript, his mind
      would have been somewhat relieved. On this subject Mr. Beaumont pondered
      all the way that he rode home, and on this subject he was still meditating
      when he saw his mother standing on the steps, where we left her when Miss
      Hunter's carriage drove away.

      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I shall in all my best obey you, madam." HAMLET.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you meet Miss Hunter, my dear son?" said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, ma'am, I just passed the carriage in the avenue: she is going home,
      is not she?" said he, rather in a tone of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, poor thing! yes," said Mrs. Beaumont, in a most pathetic tone: "ah,
      poor thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, ma'am, what has happened to her? What's the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Matter? Oh, nothing!&mdash;Did I say that any thing was the matter? Don't
      speak so loud," whispered she: "your groom heard every word we said; stay
      till he is out of hearing, and then we can talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care if all the world hears what I say," cried Mr. Beaumont
      hastily: but, as if suppressing his rising indignation, he, with a milder
      look and tone, added, "I cannot conceive, my dear mother, why you are
      always so afraid of being overheard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Servants, my dear, make such mischief, you know, by misunderstanding and
      misrepresenting every thing they hear; and they repeat things so oddly,
      and raise such strange reports!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "True&mdash;very true indeed, ma'am," said Mr. Beaumont. "You are quite
      right, and I beg pardon for being so hasty&mdash;I wish you could teach me
      a little of your patience and prudence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prudence! ah! my dear Edward, 'tis only time and sad experience of the
      world can teach that to people of <i>our</i> open tempers. I was at your
      age ten times more imprudent and unsuspicious than you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you, ma'am?&mdash;But I don't think I am unsuspicious. I was when I
      was a boy&mdash;I wish we could continue children always in some things. I
      hate suspicion in any body&mdash;but more than in any one else, I hate it
      in myself. And yet&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaumont hesitated, and his mother instantly went on with a fluent
      panegyric upon the hereditary unsuspiciousness of his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, madam, were you not saying something to me about Miss Hunter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was I?&mdash;Oh, I was merely going to say, that I was sorry you did not
      know she was going this morning, that you might have taken leave of her,
      poor thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take leave of her! ma'am: I bowed to her, and wished her a good morning,
      when I met her just now, and she told me she was only going to the hall
      for a day. Surely no greater leave-taking was requisite, when I am to see
      the lady again to-morrow, I presume."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is not quite so certain as she thinks, poor soul! I told her I would
      send for her again to-morrow, just to keep up her spirits at leaving me.
      Walk this way, Edward, under the shade of the trees, for I am dead with
      the heat; and you, too, look so hot! I say I am not so sure that it would
      be prudent to have her here so much, especially whilst Mr. Palmer is with
      us, you know&mdash;" Mrs. Beaumont paused, as if waiting for an assent, or
      a dissent, or a leading hint how to proceed: but her son persisting in
      perverse silence, she was forced to repeat, "You know, Edward, my dear,
      you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, indeed, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, not I, ma'am. I don't know, for the soul of me, what Mr. Palmer's
      coming has to do with Miss Hunter's going. There's room enough in the
      house, I suppose, for each of them, and all of us to play our parts. As to
      the rest, the young lady's coming or going is quite a matter of
      indifference to me, except, of course, as far as politeness and
      hospitality go. But all that I leave to you, who do the honours for me so
      well."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont's ideas were utterly thrown out of their order by this
      speech, no part of which was exactly what she wished or expected: not that
      any of the sentiments it contained or suggested were new to her; but she
      was not prepared to meet them thus clothed in distinct words, and in such
      a compact form. She had drawn up her forces for battle in an order which
      this unexpectedly decisive movement of the enemy discomfited; and a less
      able tactician might have been, in these circumstances, not only
      embarrassed, but utterly defeated: yet, however unprepared for this sudden
      shock, with admirable generalship our female Hannibal, falling back in the
      centre, admitted him to advance impetuous and triumphant, till she had him
      completely surrounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My being of age in a few days," continued Mr. Beaumont, "will not make
      any difference, surely; I depend upon it, that you will always invite
      whomever you like to this house, of which I hope, my dear mother, you will
      always do me the favour to be the mistress&mdash;till I marry, at least.
      For my wife's feelings," added he, smiling, "I can't engage, before I have
      her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And before we know who she is to be," said Mrs. Beaumont, carelessly.
      "Time enough, as you say, to think of that. Besides, there are few women
      in the world, I know scarcely one, with whom, in the relation of mother
      and daughter-in-law, I should wish to live. But wherever I live, my dear
      son, as long as I have a house, I hope you will always do me the justice
      and the pleasure to consider yourself as its master. Heaven knows I shall
      never give any other man a right to dispute with you the sovereignty of my
      castle, or my cottage, whichever it may be. As to the rest," pursued Mrs.
      Beaumont, "you cannot marry against my wishes, my dear Edward; for your
      wishes on this, as on all other subjects, will ever govern mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her son kissed her hand with warm gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not, I hope, think that I seek to prolong my regency, or to
      assume undue power or influence in affairs," continued Mrs. Beaumont, "if
      I hint to you in general terms what I think may contribute to your
      happiness. You must afterwards decide for yourself; and are now, as you
      have ever been, master, to do as you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too much&mdash;too much. I have had too much liberty, and have too little
      acquired the habit of commanding my will and my passions by my reason. Of
      this I am sensible. My excellent friend, Captain Walsingham, told me, some
      years ago, that this was the fault of my character, and he charged me to
      watch over myself; and so I have; but not so strictly, I fear, as if he
      had watched along with me.&mdash;&mdash;Well, ma'am, you were going to
      give me some advice; I am all attention."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear son, Captain Walsingham showed his judgment more, perhaps, in
      pointing out causes than effects. The weakness of a fond mother, I am
      sensible, did indulge you in childhood, and, perhaps, more imprudently in
      youth, with an unlimited liberty to judge and act for yourself. Your
      mother's system of education came, alas! more from her heart than her
      head. Captain Walsingham himself cannot be more sensible of my errors than
      I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Captain Walsingham, believe me, mother, never mentioned this in reproach
      to you. He is not a man to teach a son to see his mother's errors&mdash;if
      she had any. He always spoke of you with the greatest respect. And since I
      must, at my own expense, do him justice, it was, I well remember, upon
      some occasion where I spoke too hastily, and insisted upon my will in
      opposition to yours, madam, that Captain Walsingham took me aside, and
      represented to me the fault into which my want of command over myself had
      betrayed me. This he did so forcibly, that I have never from that hour to
      this (I flatter myself) on any material occasion, forgotten the impression
      he made on my mind. But, madam, I interrupt you: you were going to give me
      your advice about&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no&mdash;no advice&mdash;no advice; you are, in my opinion, fully
      adequate to the direction of your own conduct. I was merely going to
      suggest, that, since you have not been accustomed to control from a
      mother, and since you have, thank Heaven! a high spirit, that would sooner
      break than bend, it must be essential to your happiness to have a wife of
      a compliant, gentle temper; not fond of disputing the right, or attached
      to her own opinions; not one who would be tenacious of rule, and
      unseasonably inflexible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unseasonably inflexible! Undoubtedly, ma'am. Yet I should despise a
      mean-spirited wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure you would. But compliance that proceeds from affection, you
      know, can never deserve to be called mean-spirited&mdash;nor would it so
      appear to you. I am persuaded that there is a degree of fondness, of
      affection, enthusiastic affection, which disposes the temper always to a
      certain softness and yieldingness, which, I conceive, would be peculiarly
      attractive to you, and essential to your happiness: in short, I know your
      temper could not bear contradiction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, indeed, ma'am, you are quite mistaken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite mistaken! and at the very moment he reddens with anger, because I
      contradict, even in the softest, gentlest manner in my power, his opinion
      of himself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't understand me, indeed, you don't understand me," said Mr.
      Beaumont, beating with his whip the leaves of a bush which was near him.
      "Either you don't understand me, or I don't understand you. I am much more
      able to bear contradiction than you think I am, provided it be direct. But
      I do not love&mdash;what I am doing at this instant," added he, smiling&mdash;"I
      don't love beating about the bush."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look there now!&mdash;Strange creatures you men are! So like he looks to
      his poor father, who used to tell me that he loved to be contradicted, and
      yet who would not, I am sure, have lived three days with any woman who had
      ventured to contradict him directly. Whatever influence I obtained in his
      heart, and whatever happiness we enjoyed in our union, I attribute to my
      trusting to my observations on his character rather than to his own
      account of himself. Therefore I may be permitted to claim some judgment of
      what would suit your hereditary temper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, ma'am, certainly. But to come to the point at once, may I ask
      this plain question&mdash;Do you, by these reflections, mean to allude to
      any particular persons? Is there any woman in the world you at this
      instant would wish me to marry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;Miss Walsingham."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaumont started with joyful surprise, when his mother thus
      immediately pronounced the very name he wished to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You surprise and delight me, my dear mother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surprise!&mdash;How can that be?&mdash;Surely you must know my high
      opinion of Miss Walsingham. But&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;you added <i>but</i>&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no woman who may not be taxed with a <i>but</i>&mdash;yet it is
      not for her friend to lower her merit. My only objection to her is&mdash;I
      shall infallibly affront you, if I name it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Name it! name it! You will not affront me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My only objection to her then is, her superiority. She is so superior,
      that, forgive me, I don't know any man, yourself not excepted, who is at
      all her equal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think precisely as you do, and rejoice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rejoice? why there I cannot sympathize with you. I own, as a mother, I
      should feel a little&mdash;a little mortified to see my son not the
      superior; and when the comparison is to be daily and hourly made, and to
      last for life, and all the world to see it as well as myself. I own I have
      a mother's vanity. I should wish to see my son always what he has hitherto
      been&mdash;the superior, and master in his own house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaumont made no reply to these insinuations, but walked on in
      silence; and his mother, unable to determine precisely whether the
      vexation apparent in his countenance proceeded from disapprobation of her
      observations, or from their working the effect she desired upon his pride,
      warily waited till he should betray some decisive symptom of his feelings.
      But she waited in vain&mdash;he was resolved not to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is not a woman upon earth I should wish so much to have as a
      daughter-in-law, a companion, and a friend, as Miss Walsingham. You must
      be convinced," resumed Mrs. Beaumont, "so far as I am concerned, it is the
      most desirable thing in the world. But I should think it my duty to put my
      own feelings and wishes out of the question, and to make myself prefer
      whomsoever, all things considered, my judgment tells me would make you the
      happiest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And whom would your judgment prefer, madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why&mdash;I am not at liberty to tell&mdash;unless I could explain all my
      reasons. Indeed, I know not what to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear madam, explain all your reasons, or we shall never understand one
      another, and never come to an end of these half explanations."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here they were interrupted by seeing Mr. Twigg, a courtly clergyman,
      coming towards them. Beaumont was obliged to endure his tiresome flattery
      upon the beauties of Beaumont Park, and upon the judicious improvements
      that were making, had been made, and would, no doubt, be very soon made.
      Mrs. Beaumont, at last, relieved his or her own impatience by
      commissioning Mr. Twigg to walk round the improvements by himself. By
      himself she insisted it should be, that she might have his unbiassed
      judgment upon the two lines which had been marked for the new belt or
      screen; and he was also to decide whether they should call it a belt or a
      screen.&mdash;Honoured with this commission, he struck off into the walk
      to which Mrs. Beaumont pointed, and began his solitary progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaumont then urged his mother to go on with her explanation. Mrs.
      Beaumont thought that she could not hazard much by flattering the vanity
      of a man on that subject on which perhaps it is most easily flattered;
      therefore, after sufficient delicacy of circumlocution, she informed her
      son that there was a young lady who was actually dying for love of him;
      whose extreme fondness would make her live but in him; and who, besides
      having a natural ductility of character, and softness of temper, was
      perfectly free from any formidable superiority of intellect, and had the
      most exalted opinion of his capacity, as well as of his character and
      accomplishments; in short, such an enthusiastic adoration, as would induce
      that belief in the infallibility of a husband, which must secure to him
      the fullest enjoyment of domestic peace, power, and pre-eminence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaumont seemed less moved than his mother had calculated that the
      vanity of man must be, by such a declaration&mdash;discovery it could not
      be called. "If I am to take all this seriously, madam," replied he,
      laughing, "and if, <i>au pied de la lettre</i> my vanity is to believe
      that this damsel is dying for love; yet, still I have so little chivalry
      in my nature, that I cannot understand how it would add to my happiness to
      sacrifice myself to save her life. That I am well suited to her, I am as
      willing as vanity can make me to believe; but how is it to be proved that
      the lady is suited to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, these things do not admit of logical proof."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;moral, sentimental, or any kind of proof you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you no pity? and is not pity akin to love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Akin! Oh, yes, ma'am, it is akin; but for that very reason it may not be
      a friend&mdash;relations, you know, in these days, are as often enemies as
      friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vile pun! far-fetched quibble!&mdash;provoking boy!&mdash;But I see you
      are not in a humour to be serious, so I will take another time to talk to
      you of this affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now or never, ma'am, for mercy's sake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mercy's sake! you who show none&mdash;Ah! this is the way with you men;
      all this is play to you, but death to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Death! dear ma'am; ladies, you know as well as I do, don't die of love in
      these days&mdash;you would not make a fool of your son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could not; nor could any other woman&mdash;that is clear: but amongst
      us, I am afraid we have, undesignedly indeed, but irremediably, made a
      fool of this poor confiding girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, ma'am, in whom did she confide? not in me, I'll swear. I have
      nothing to reproach myself with, thank God!&mdash;My conscience is clear;
      I have been as ungallant as possible. I have been as cruel as my nature
      would permit. I am sure no one can charge me with giving false promises&mdash;I
      scarcely speak&mdash;nor false hopes, for I scarcely look at the young
      lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, then, you know who the young lady in question is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I ought not to pretend to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would be useless affectation, alas! for I fear many know, and have
      seen, and heard, much more than you have&mdash;or I either."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mrs. Beaumont observed that her son's colour changed, and that he
      suddenly grew serious: aware that she had now touched upon the right
      chord, she struck it again "with a master's hand and prophet's fire." She
      declared that all the world took it for granted that Miss Hunter was to be
      married to Mr. Beaumont; that it was talked of every where; that she was
      asked continually by her correspondents, when the marriage was to take
      place?&mdash;in confirmation of which assertion, she produced bundles of
      letters from her pockets, from Mrs. and Miss, and from Lady This, and Lady
      That.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay," continued she, "if it were confined even to the circle of one's
      private friends and acquaintance, I should not so much mind it, for one
      might contradict, and have it contradicted, and one might send the poor
      thing away to some watering-place, and the report might die away, as
      reports do&mdash;sometimes. But all that sort of thing it is too late to
      think of now&mdash;for the thing is public! quite public! got into the
      newspapers! Here's a paragraph I cut out this very morning from my paper,
      lest the poor girl should see it. The other day, I believe you saw it
      yourself, there was something of the same sort. 'We hear that, as soon as
      he comes of age, Mr. Beaumont, of Beaumont Park, is to lead to the altar
      of Hymen, Miss Hunter, sister to Sir John Hunter, of Devonshire.' Well,&mdash;after
      you left the room, Albina took up the paper you had been reading; and when
      she saw this paragraph, I thought she would have dropped. I did not know
      what to do. Whatever I could say, you know, would only make it worse. I
      tried to turn it off, and talked of twenty things; but it would not do&mdash;no,
      no, it is too serious for that: well, though I believe she would rather
      have put her hand in the fire, she had the courage to speak to me about it
      herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what did she say, ma'am?" inquired Mr. Beaumont, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor simple creature! she had but one idea&mdash;that you had seen it!
      that she would not for the world you had read it. What would you think of
      her&mdash;she should never be able to meet you again&mdash;What could she
      do? It must be contradicted&mdash;somebody must contradict it. Then she
      worried me to have it contradicted in the papers. I told her I did not
      well know how that could be done, and urged that it would be much more
      prudent not to fix attention upon the parties by more paragraphs. But she
      was <i>not</i> in a state to think of prudence;&mdash;<i>no</i>. What
      would you think was the only idea in her mind?&mdash;If I would not write,
      she would write that minute herself, and sign her name. This, and a
      thousand wild things, she said, till I was forced to be quite angry, and
      to tell her she must be governed by those who had more discretion than
      herself. Then she was so subdued, so ashamed&mdash;really my heart bled
      for her, even whilst I scolded her. But it is quite necessary to be harsh
      with her; for she has no more foresight, nor art, nor command of herself
      sometimes, than a child of five years old. I assure you, I was rejoiced to
      get her away before Mr. Palmer came, for a new eye coming into a family
      sees so much one wouldn't wish to be seen. You know it would be terrible
      to have the poor young creature <i>commit</i> and expose herself to a
      stranger so early in life. Indeed, as it is, I am persuaded no one will
      ever think of marrying her, if you do not.&mdash;&mdash;In worldly
      prudence&mdash;but of that she has not an atom&mdash;in worldly prudence
      she might do better, or as well, certainly; for her fortune will be very
      considerable. Sir John means to add to it, when he gets the Wigram estate;
      and the old uncle, Wigram, can't live for ever. But poor Albina, I dare
      swear, does not know what fortune she is to have, nor what you have. Love!
      love! all for love!&mdash;and all in vain. She is certainly very much to
      be pitied."
    </p>
    <p>
      Longer might Mrs. Beaumont have continued in monologue, without danger of
      interruption from her son, who stood resolved to hear the utmost sum of
      all that she should say on the subject. Never interrupting her, he only
      filled certain pauses, that seemed expectant of reply, with the phrases&mdash;"I
      am very sorry, indeed, ma'am"&mdash;and, "Really, ma'am, it is out of my
      power to help it." But Mrs. Beaumont observed that the latter phrase had
      been omitted as she proceeded&mdash;and "<i>I am very sorry indeed, ma'am,</i>"
      he repeated less as words of course, and more and more as if they came
      from the heart. Having so far, successfully, as she thought, worked upon
      her son's good-nature, and seeing her daughter through the trees coming
      towards them, she abruptly exclaimed, "Promise me, at all events, dearest
      Edward, I conjure you; promise me that you will not make proposals <i>any
      where else</i>, without letting me know of it beforehand,&mdash;and give
      me time," joining her hands in a supplicating attitude, "give me but a few
      weeks, to prepare my poor little Albina for this sad, sad stroke!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I promise you, madam, that I will not, directly or indirectly, make an
      offer of my hand or heart to any woman, without previously letting you
      know my determination. And as for a few weeks, more or less&mdash;my
      mother, surely, need not supplicate, but simply let me know her wishes&mdash;even
      without her reasons, they would have been sufficient with me. Do I satisfy
      you now, madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More than satisfy&mdash;as you ever do, ever will, my dear son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you will require no more on this subject&mdash;I must be left master
      of myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indubitably&mdash;certainly&mdash;master of yourself&mdash;most certainly&mdash;of
      course."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaumont was going to add something beginning with, "It is better, at
      once, to tell you, that I can never&mdash;" But Mrs. Beaumont stopped him
      with, "Hush! my dear, hush! not a word more, for here is Amelia, and I
      cannot talk on this subject before her, you know.&mdash;&mdash;My beloved
      Amelia, how languid you look! I fear that, to please me, you have taken
      too long a walk; and Mr. Palmer won't see you in your best looks, after
      all.&mdash;What note is that you have in your hand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A note from Miss Walsingham, mamma."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! the chickenpox! take caer! letters, notes, every thing may convey the
      infection," cried Mrs. Beaumont, snatching the paper. "How could dearest
      Miss Walsingham be so giddy as to answer my note, after what I said in my
      postscript!&mdash;How did this note come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the little postboy, mamma; I met him at the porter's lodge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what is all this strange thing?" said Mrs. Beaumont, after having
      read the note twice over.&mdash;It contained a certificate from the parish
      minister and churchwardens, apothecary, and surgeon, bearing witness, one
      and all, that there was no individual, man, woman, or child, in the
      parish, or within three miles of Walsingham House, who was even under any
      suspicion of having the chickenpox.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father desires me to send Mrs. Beaumont the enclosed <i>clean bill of
      health</i>&mdash;by which she will find that we need be no longer subject
      to quarantine; and, unless some other reasons prevent our having the
      pleasure of seeing her, we may hope soon that she will favour us with her
      long promised visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours, sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
      "MARIANNE WALSINGHAM."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am delighted," said Mrs. Beaumont, "to find it was a false report, and
      that we shall not be kept, the Lord knows how long, away from the dear
      Walsinghams."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then we can go to them to-morrow, can't we, mamma? And I will write, and
      say so, shall I?" said Amelia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No need to write, my dear; if we promise for any particular day, and are
      not able to go, that seems unkind, and is taken ill, you see. And as Mr.
      Palmer is coming, we can't leave him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he will go with us surely," said Mr. Beaumont. "The Walsinghams are
      as much his relations as we are; and if he comes two hundred miles to see
      us, he will, surely, go seven to see them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," said Mrs. Beaumont; "but it is civil and kind to leave him to fix
      his own day, poor old gentleman. After so long a journey, we must allow
      him some rest. Consider, he can't go galloping about as you do, dear
      Edward."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Amelia, "as the Walsinghams know he is to be in the country,
      they will of course come to see him immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do they know he is to be in the country?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought&mdash;I took it for granted, you told them so, mamma, when you
      wrote about not going to Walsingham House, on Mr. Walsingham's birthday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear; I was so full of the chickenpox, and terror about you, I
      could think of nothing else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, dear mother&mdash;but now that is out of the question, I had
      best write a line by the return of the postboy, to say, that Mr. Palmer is
      to be here to-day, and that he stays only one week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly! love&mdash;but let me write about it, for I have particular
      reasons. And, my dear, now we are by ourselves, let me caution you not to
      mention that Mr. Palmer can stay but one week: in the first place it is
      uncivil to him, for we are not sure of it, and it is like driving him
      away; and in the next place, there are reasons I can't explain to you,
      that know so little of the world, my dear Amelia&mdash;but, in general, it
      is always foolish to mention things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always foolish to mention things!" cried Mr. Beaumont, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of this sort, I mean," said Mrs. Beaumont, a little disconcerted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of what sort?" persisted her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! my dear; here's the postboy and the ass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any letters, my good little boy? Any letters for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I has, madam, a many for the house. I does not know for who&mdash;the bag
      will tell," said the boy, unstrapping the bag from his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give it to me, then," said Mrs. Beaumont: "I am anxious for letters
      always." She was peculiarly anxious now to open the post-bag, to put a
      stop to a conversation which did not please her. Whilst seated on a rustic
      seat, under a spreading beech, our heroine, with her accustomed looks of
      mystery, examined the seals of her numerous and important letters, to
      ascertain whether they had been opened at the post-office, or whether
      their folds might have been pervious to any prying eye. Her son tore the
      covers off the newspapers; and, as he unfolded one, Amelia leaned upon his
      shoulder, and whispered softly, "Any news of the fleet, brother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont, than whom Fine-ear himself had not quicker auditory nerves,
      especially for indiscreet whispers, looked up from her letters, and
      examined, unperceived, the countenance of Amelia, who was searching with
      eagerness the columns of the paper. As Mr. Beaumont turned over the leaf,
      Amelia looked up, and, seeing her mother's eyes fixed upon her, coloured;
      and from want of presence of mind to invent any thing better to say, asked
      if her mother wished to have the papers?
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Mrs. Beaumont, coldly, "not I, Amelia; I am not such a
      politician as you are grown."
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelia withdrew her attention, or at least her eyes, from the paper, and
      had recourse to the beech-tree, the beautiful foliage of which she studied
      with profound attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless me! here's news! news of the fleet!" cried Beaumont, turning
      suddenly to his sister; and then recollecting himself, to his mother.
      "Ma'am, they say there has been a great engagement between the French and
      Spaniards, and the English&mdash;particulars not known yet: but, they say,
      ten sail of the French line are taken, and four Spaniards blown up, and
      six Spanish men-of-war disabled, and a treasure-ship taken. Walsingham
      must have been in the engagement&mdash;My horse!&mdash;I'll gallop over
      this minute, and know from the Walsinghams if they have seen the papers,
      and if there's any thing more about it in their papers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gallop! my dearest Edward," said his mother, standing in his path; "but
      you don't consider Mr. Palmer&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn Mr. Palmer! I beg your pardon, mother&mdash;I mean no harm to the
      old gentleman&mdash;friend of my father's&mdash;great respect for him&mdash;I'll
      be back by dinner-time, back ready to receive him&mdash;he can't be here
      till six&mdash;only five by me, now! Ma'am, I shall have more than time to
      dress, too, cool as a cucumber, ready to receive the good old fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In one short hour, my dear!&mdash;seven miles to Walsingham House, and
      seven back again, and all the time you will waste there, and to dress too&mdash;only
      consider!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do consider, ma'am; and have considered every thing in the world. My
      horse will carry me there and back in fifty minutes, easily, and five to
      spare, I'll be bound. I sha'n't light&mdash;so where's the paper? I'm
      off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;order your horse, and leave me the paper, at least, while he
      is getting ready. Ride by this way, and you will find us here&mdash;where
      is this famous paragraph?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beaumont drew the paper crumpled from the pocket into which he had thrust
      it&mdash;ran off for his horse, and quickly returned mounted. "Give me the
      paper, good friends!&mdash;I'm off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Away, then, my dear; since you will heat yourself for nothing. But only
      let me point out to you," said she, holding the paper fast whilst she held
      it up to him, "that this whole report rests on no authority whatever; not
      a word of it in the gazette; not a line from the admiralty; no official
      account; no bulletin; no credit given to the rumour at Lloyd's; stocks the
      same.&mdash;And how did the news come? Not even the news-writer pretends
      it came through any the least respectable channel. A frigate in latitude
      the Lord knows what! saw a fleet in a fog&mdash;might be Spanish&mdash;might
      be French&mdash;might be English&mdash;spoke another frigate some days
      afterwards, who heard firing: well&mdash;firing says nothing. But the
      frigate turns this firing into an engagement, and a victory; and presently
      communicates the news to a collier, and the collier tells another collier,
      and so it goes up the Thames, to some wonder-maker, standing agape for a
      paragraph, to secure a dinner. To the press the news goes, just as our
      paper is coming out; and to be sure we shall have a contradiction and an
      apology in our next."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, ma'am; but I will ask Mr. Walsingham what he thinks, and show him
      the paper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do, if you like it, my dear; I never control you; but don't overheat
      yourself for nothing. What can Mr. Walsingham, or all the Walsinghams in
      the world, tell more than we can? and as to showing him the paper, you
      know he takes the same paper. But don't let me detain you.&mdash;Amelia,
      who is that coming through the gate? Mr. Palmer's servant, I protest!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well; it can't be, I see!" said Beaumont, dismounting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take away your master's horse&mdash;quick&mdash;quick!&mdash;Amelia, my
      love, to dress! I must have you ready to receive your godfather's
      blessing. Consider, Mr. Palmer was your father's earliest friend; and
      besides, he is a relation, though distant; and it is always a good and
      prudent thing to keep up relationships. Many a fine estate has come from
      very distant relations most unexpectedly. And even independently of all
      relationships, when friendships are properly cultivated, there's no
      knowing to what they may lead;&mdash;not that I look to any thing of that
      sort here. But before you see Mr. Palmer, just as we are walking home, and
      quite to ourselves, let me give you some leading hints about this old
      gentleman's character, which I have gathered, no matter how, for your
      advantage, my dear children. He is a humourist, and must not be opposed in
      any of his oddities: he is used to be waited upon, and attended to, as all
      these men are who have lived in the West Indies. A <i>bon vivant</i>, of
      course. Edward, produce your best wines&mdash;the pilau and currie, and
      all that, leave to me. I had special notice of his love for a john-doree,
      and a john-doree I have for him. But now I am going to give you the
      master-key to his heart. Like all men who have made great fortunes, he
      loves to feel continually the importance his wealth confers; he loves to
      feel that wealth does every thing; is superior to every thing&mdash;to
      birth and titles especially: it is his pride to think himself, though a
      commoner, far above any man who condescends to take a title. He hates
      persons of quality; therefore, whilst he is here, not a word in favour of
      any titled person. Forget the whole house of peers&mdash;send them all to
      Coventry&mdash;all to Coventry, remember.&mdash;And, now you have the key
      to his heart, go and dress, to be ready for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus given her private instructions, and advanced her secret plans,
      Mrs. Beaumont repaired to her toilet, well satisfied with her morning's
      work.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Chi mi fa piu carezze che non sole; O m'ha ingannato, o ingannar me
      vuole."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. George, there's nothing like Old England for comfort!" cried Mr.
      Palmer, settling himself in his arm-chair in the evening; "nothing after
      all in any part of the known world, like Old England for comfort. Why,
      madam, there's not another people in the universe that have in any of
      their languages a name even for comfort. The French have been forced to
      borrow it; but now they have got it, they don't know how to use it, nor
      even how to pronounce it, poor devils! Well, there's nothing like Old
      England for comfort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! nothing like Old England for comfort!" echoed Mrs. Beaumont, in a
      sentimental tone, though at that instant her thoughts were far distant
      from her words; for this declaration of his love for Old England alarmed
      her with the notion that he might change his mind about returning
      immediately to Jamaica, and that he might take root again and flourish for
      years to come in his native soil&mdash;perhaps in her neighbourhood, to
      the bane of all her favourite projects. What would become of her scheme of
      marrying Amelia to the baronet, and her son to the docile Albina? What
      would become of the scheme of preventing him from being acquainted with
      the Walsinghams? For a week it might be practicable to keep them asunder
      by <i>policising</i>, but this could never be effected if he were to
      settle, or even to make any long stay, in the country. The Walsinghams
      would be affronted, and then what would become of their interest in the
      county? Her son could not be returned without that. And, worse than all
      the rest, Mr. Palmer might take a fancy to see these Walsinghams, who were
      as nearly related to him as the Beaumonts; and seeing, he might prefer,
      and preferring, he might possibly leave half, nay, perhaps the whole, of
      his large fortune to them,&mdash;and thus all her hopes and projects might
      at once be frustrated. Little aware of the long and perplexing trains of
      ideas, which his honest ejaculation in favour of his native country had
      raised, Mr. Palmer went on with his own comfortable thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And of all the comforts our native land affords, I know of none so
      grateful to the heart," continued he, "as good friends, which are to be
      found nowhere else in such perfection. A man at my time of life misses
      many an old friend on his return to his native country; but then he sees
      them still in their representatives, and loves them again in their
      children. Mr. Beaumont looked at me at that instant, so like his father&mdash;he
      is the image of what my friend was, when I first knew him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am rejoiced you see the likeness," said Mrs. Beaumont. "Amelia, my
      dear, pour out the coffee."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Miss Beaumont, too, has just his expression of countenance, which
      surprises me more, in her delicate features. Upon my word, I have reason
      to be proud of my god-daughter, as far as appearances go; and with English
      women, appearances, fair as they may be, seldom are even so good as the
      truth. There's her father's smile again for me&mdash;young lady, if that
      smile deceives, there's no truth in woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not you find our coffee here very bad, compared with what you have
      been used to abroad?" said Mrs. Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do rejoice to find myself here quiet in the country," continued Mr.
      Palmer, without hearing the lady's question; "nothing after all like a
      good old English family, where every thing speaks plenty and hospitality,
      without waste or ostentation; and where you are received with a hearty
      welcome, without compliments; and let do just as you please, without form,
      and without being persecuted by politeness."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the image of an English country family impressed early upon the
      good old gentleman's imagination, which had remained there fresh and
      unchanged since the days of his youth; and he now took it for granted that
      he should see it realized in the family of his late friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was afraid," resumed Mrs. Beaumont, "that after being so long
      accustomed to a West-Indian life, you would find many things unpleasant to
      your feelings here. But you are so kind, so accommodating. Is it really
      possible that you have not, since your return to England, experienced any
      uncomfortable sensations, suffered any serious injury to your health, my
      dear sir, from the damps and chills of our climate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, now I think of it, I have&mdash;I have a caugh," said Mr. Palmer,
      coughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont officiously shut the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do acknowledge that England is not quite so superior to all other
      countries in her climate as in every thing else: yet I don't 'damn the
      climate like a lord.' At my time of life, a man must expect to be a
      valetudinarian, and it would be unjust to blame one's native climate for
      that. But a man of seventy-five must live where he can, not where he will;
      and Dr. Y&mdash;&mdash; tells me that I can live nowhere but in the West
      Indies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sir, never mind Dr. Y&mdash;&mdash;," exclaimed young Beaumont: "live
      with us in England. Many Englishmen live to a great age surely, let people
      say what they will of the climate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, perhaps, brother," interposed Amelia, "those who, like Mr. Palmer,
      have lived much in a warm climate, might find a return to a cold country
      dangerous; and we should consider what is best for him, not merely what is
      most agreeable to ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, my dearest Amelia," said Mrs. Beaumont; "and to be sure, Dr. Y&mdash;&mdash;
      is one of our most skilful physicians. I could not be so rash or so
      selfish as to set my private wishes, or my private opinion, in opposition
      to Dr. Y&mdash;&mdash;'s advice; but surely, my dear sir, you won't let
      one physician, however eminent, send you away from us all, and banish you
      again from England? We have a very clever physician here, Dr. Wheeler, in
      whom I have the greatest confidence. In my own case, I confess, I should
      prefer his judgment to any of the London fashionable physicians, who are
      so fine and so hurried, that they can't take time to study one's
      particular constitution, and hear all one has to say to them. Now that is
      Wheeler's great excellence&mdash;and I should so like to hear his opinion.
      I am sure, if he gives it against me, I will not say a word more: if he
      decide for Jamaica, I may be vexed, but I should make it a point of
      conscience to submit, and not to urge my good friend to stay in England at
      his own peril. Happy they who can live where they please, and whose
      fortune puts it in their power to purchase any climate, and to combine the
      comforts and luxuries of all countries!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing more was said upon the subject: Mrs. Beaumont turned the
      conversation to the different luxuries of the West and East Indies. Mr.
      Palmer, fatigued by his journey, retired early to rest, little dreaming
      that his kind hostess waked, whilst he slept, for the purpose of preparing
      a physician to give a proper opinion upon his case. Mrs. Beaumont left a
      note to her favourite Dr. Wheeler, to be sent very early in the morning.
      As if by accident, the doctor dropped in at breakfast time, and Mrs.
      Beaumont declared that it was the luckiest chance imaginable, that he
      should happen to call just when she was wishing to see him. When the
      question in debate was stated to him, he, with becoming gravity of
      countenance and suavity of manner, entered into a discussion upon the
      effect of hot and cold climates upon the solids and fluids, and nervous
      system in general; then upon English constitutions in particular; and,
      lastly, upon <i>idiosyncrasies</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last word cost Mr. Palmer half his breakfast: on hearing it he turned
      down his cup with a profound sigh, and pushed his plate from him;
      indications which did not escape the physician's demure eye. Gaining
      confidence from the weakness of the patient, Dr. Wheeler now boldly
      pronounced, that, in his opinion, any gentleman who, after having
      habituated himself long to a hot climate, as Jamaica, for instance, should
      come late in life to reside in a colder climate, as England, for example,
      must run very great hazard indeed&mdash;nay, he could almost venture to
      predict, would fall a victim to the sudden tension of the lax fibres.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though a man of sound good sense in most things, Mr. Palmer's weakness
      was, on medical subjects, as great as his ignorance; his superstitious
      faith in physicians was as implicit as either Dr. Wheeler or Mrs. Beaumont
      could desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said Mr. Palmer, with a sigh still deeper than the first&mdash;for
      the first was for himself, and the second for his country&mdash;"then
      England, Old England! farewell for ever! All my judges pronounce sentence
      of transportation upon me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaumont and Amelia, in eager and persuasive tones of remonstrance and
      expostulation, at once addressed the doctor, to obtain a mitigation or
      suspension of his sentence. Dr. Wheeler, albeit unused to the imperative
      mood, reiterated his <i>dictum</i>. Though little accustomed to hold his
      opinion against the arguments or the wishes of the rich and fair, he, upon
      this occasion, stood his ground against Miss and Mr. Beaumont wonderfully
      well for nearly five minutes; till, to his utter perplexity and dismay, he
      saw Mrs. Beaumont appear amongst his assailants.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I said I would submit, and not say a word, if Dr. Wheeler was
      against me," she began; "but I cannot sit by silent: I must protest
      against this cruel, cruel decree, so contrary too to what I hoped and
      expected would be Dr. Wheeler's opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Dr. Wheeler twinkled and seemed as if he would have rubbed his eyes,
      not sure whether he was awake or in a dream. In his perplexity, he
      apprehended that he had misunderstood Mrs. Beaumont's note, and he now
      prepared to make his way round again through the solids and the fluids,
      and the whole nervous system, till, by favour of <i>idiosyncrasy</i>, he
      hoped to get out of his difficulty, and to allow Mr. Palmer to remain on
      British ground. Mrs. Beaumont's face, in spite of her powers of
      simulation, lengthened and lengthened, and darkened and darkened, as he
      proceeded in his recantation; but, when the exception to the general axiom
      was fairly made out, and a clear permit to remain in England granted, by
      such high medical authority, she forced a smile, and joined loudly in the
      general congratulations. Whilst her son was triumphing and shaking hands
      with Mr. Palmer, she slipped down stairs after Dr. Wheeler.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, doctor! What have you done! Ruined me! ruined me! Didn't you read my
      note? Didn't you <i>understand</i> it?&mdash;I thought a word to the wise
      was enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why!&mdash;then it was as I understood it at first? So I thought; but
      then I fancied I must be mistaken afterwards; for when I expected support,
      my dear madam, you opposed my opinion in favour of Jamaica more warmly
      than any one, and what was I to think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To think! Oh, my dear doctor, you might have guessed that was only a sham
      opposition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear ma'am," cried Dr. Wheeler, who, though the mildest of men,
      was now worked up to something like indignation, "my dear ma'am&mdash;sham
      upon sham is too much for any man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor went down stairs murmuring. Thus, by excess of hypocrisy, our
      heroine disgusted even her own adherents, in which she has the honour to
      resemble some of the most wily politicians famous in English history. But
      she was too wise ever to let any one who could serve or injure her go
      discontented out of her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, good Dr. Wheeler, I never saw you angry before. Come, come,"
      cried Mrs. Beaumont, sliding a <i>douceur</i> into his hand, "friends must
      not be vexed for trifles; it was only a mistake <i>de part et d'autre</i>,
      and you'll return here to-morrow, in your way home, and breakfast with us;
      and now we understand one another. And," added she, in a whisper, "we can
      talk over things, and have your cool judgment best, when only you, and I,
      and Mr. Palmer, are present. You comprehend."
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who practise many manoeuvres, and carry on many intrigues at the
      same time, have this advantage, that if one fails, the success of another
      compensates for the disappointment. However she might have been vexed by
      this slight <i>contre-temps</i> with Dr. Wheeler, Mrs. Beaumont had ample
      compensation of different sorts this day; some due to her own exertions,
      some owing to accident. Her own exertions prevented her dear Albina Hunter
      from returning; for Mrs. Beaumont never sent the promised carriage&mdash;only
      a note of apology&mdash;a nail had run into one of the coach-horse's feet.
      To accident she owed that the Walsinghams were not at home when her son
      galloped over to see them the next morning, and to inquire what news from
      Captain Walsingham. That day's paper also brought a contradiction of the
      report of the engagement and victory; so that Mrs. Beaumont's
      apprehensions on this subject were allayed; and she had no doubt that, by
      proper management, with a sufficient number of notes and messages,
      misunderstandings, lame horses, and crossings upon the road, she might
      actually get through the week without letting the Walsinghams see Mr.
      Palmer; or at least without more than a <i>vis</i>, or a morning visit,
      from which no great danger could be apprehended. "Few, indeed, have so
      much character," thought she, "or so much dexterity in showing it, as to
      make a dangerous impression in the course of a formal morning visit."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Ah! c'est mentir tant soit peu; j'en conviens; C'est un grand mal&mdash;mais
      il produit un bien." VOLTAIRE.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third day went off still more successfully. Dr. Wheeler called at
      breakfast, frightened Mr. Palmer out of his senses about his health, and
      convinced him that his life depended upon his immediate return to the
      climate of Jamaica:&mdash;so this point was decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont, calculating justly that the Walsinghams would return Mr.
      Beaumont's visit, and come to pay their respects to Mr. Palmer this
      morning, settled, as soon as breakfast was over, a plan of operations
      which should keep Mr. Palmer out till dinner-time. He must see the
      charming drive which her son had made round his improvements; and she must
      have the pleasure of showing it to him herself; and she assured him that
      he might trust to her driving.
    </p>
    <p>
      So into Mrs. Beaumont's garden-chair he got; and when she had him fairly
      prisoner, she carried him far away from all danger of intruding visitors.
      It may readily be supposed that our heroine made good use of the five or
      six hours' leisure for manoeuvring which she thus secured.
    </p>
    <p>
      So frank and cordial was this simple-hearted old man, any one but Mrs.
      Beaumont would have thought that with him no manoeuvring was necessary;
      that she need only to have trusted to his friendship and generosity, and
      have directly told him her wishes. He was so prepossessed in her favour,
      as being the widow of his friend, that he was almost incapable of
      suspecting her of any unhandsome conduct; besides, having had little
      converse with modern ladies, his imagination was so prepossessed with the
      old-fashioned picture of a respectable widow lady and guardian mother,
      that he took it for granted Mrs. Beaumont was just like one of the good
      matrons of former times, like Lady Bountiful, or Lady Lizard; and, as
      such, he spoke to her of her family concerns, in all the openness of a
      heart which knew no guile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, my good Mistress Beaumont, you must look upon me just as my friend
      the colonel would have done; as a man, who has your family interests at
      heart just as much as if I were one of yourselves. And let me in to all
      your little affairs, and trust me with all your little plans, and let us
      talk over things together, and settle how every thing can be done for the
      best for the young people. You know, I have no relations in the world but
      your family and the Walsinghams, of whom, by-the-bye, I know nothing. No
      one living has any claim upon me: I can leave or give my own just as I
      please; and you and yours are, of course, my first objects&mdash;and for
      the how, and the what, and the when, I must consult you; and only beg you
      to keep it in mind, that I would as soon <i>give</i> as <i>bequeath</i>,
      and rather; for as to what a man leaves to his friends, he can only have
      the satisfaction of thinking that they will be the better for him after he
      is dead and gone, which is but cold comfort; but what he gives he has the
      warm comfort of seeing them enjoy whilst he is alive with them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a generous sentiment!" exclaimed Mrs. Beaumont, "and so unlike
      persons in general who have large fortunes at their disposal! I feel so
      much obliged, so excessively&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, not at all, not at all&mdash;no more of that, no more of
      that, my good lady. The colonel and I were friends; so there can be no
      obligation between us, nor thanks, nor speeches. But, just as if you were
      talking to yourself, tell me your mind. And if there are any little
      embarrassments that the son may want to clear off on coming of age; or if
      there's any thing wanting to your jointure, my dear madam; or if there
      should be any marriages in the wind, where a few thousands, more or less,
      might be the making or the breaking of a heart;&mdash;let me hear about it
      all: and do me the justice to let me have the pleasure of making the young
      folks, and the old folks too, happy their own way; for I have no notion of
      insisting on all people being happy my way&mdash;no, no! I've too much
      English liberty in me for that; and I'm sure, you, my good lady, are as
      great a foe as I am to all family managements and mysteries, where the old
      don't know what the young do, nor the young what the old think. No, no&mdash;that's
      all nonsense and French convent work&mdash;nothing like a good old English
      family. So, my dear Mistress Beaumont, out with it all, and make me one of
      yourselves, free of the family from this minute. Here's my hand and heart
      upon it&mdash;an old friend may presume so far."
    </p>
    <p>
      This frankness would have opened any heart except Mrs. Beaumont's; but it
      is the misfortune of artful people that they cannot believe others to be
      artless: either they think simplicity of character folly; or else they
      suspect that openness is only affected, as a bait to draw them into
      snares. Our heroine balanced for a moment between these two notions. She
      could not believe Mr. Palmer to be an absolute fool&mdash;no; his having
      made such a large fortune forbad that thought. Then he must have thrown
      himself thus open merely to <i>try her</i>, and to come at the knowledge
      of debts and embarrassments, which, if brought to light, would lower his
      opinion of the prudence of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My excellent friend, to be candid with you," she began, "there is no need
      of your generosity at present, to relieve my son from any embarrassments;
      for I know that he has no debts whatever. And I am confident he will make
      my jointure every thing, and more than every thing, I could desire. And,
      as to marriages, my Amelia is so young, there's time enough to consider."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, true; and she does well to take time to consider. But though I
      don't understand these matters much, she looks mightily like the notion I
      have of a girl that's a little bit in love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In love! Oh, my dear sir! you don't say so&mdash;in love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I suppose I should not say <i>in love</i>; there's some other way of
      expressing it come into fashion since my time, no doubt. And even then, I
      know that was not to be said of a young lady, till signing and sealing
      day; but it popped out, and I can't get it back again, so you must even
      let it pass. And what harm? for you know, madam, without love, what would
      become of the world?&mdash;though I was jilted once and away, I
      acknowledge&mdash;but forgive and forget. I don't like the girl a whit the
      worse for being a little bit tender-hearted. For I'm morally certain, even
      from the little I have heard her say, and from the way she has been
      brought up, and from her being her father's daughter, and her mother's,
      madam, she could not fix her affections on any one that would not do
      honour to her choice, or&mdash;which is only saying the same thing in
      other words&mdash;that you and I should not approve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! there's the thing!" said Mrs. Beaumont, sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why now I took it into my head from a blush I saw this morning, though
      how I came to notice it, I don't know; for to my recollection I have not
      noticed a girl's blushing before these twenty years&mdash;but, to be sure,
      here I have as near an interest, almost, as if she were my own daughter&mdash;I
      say, from the blush I saw this morning, when young Beaumont was talking of
      the gallop he had taken to inquire about Captain Walsingham, I took it
      into my head that he was the happy man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! my dear sir, he never made any proposals for Amelia." That was
      strictly true. "Nor, I am sure, ever thought of it, as far as ever I
      heard."
    </p>
    <p>
      The saving clause of "<i>as far as ever I heard</i>," prevented this last
      assertion from coming under that description of falsehoods denominated
      downright lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, how could he?" pursued Mrs. Beaumont, "for you know he is no
      match for Amelia; he has nothing in the world but his commission. No;
      there never was any proposal from that quarter; and, of course, it is
      impossible my daughter could think of a man who has no thoughts of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know best, my good madam; I merely spoke at random. I'm the worst
      guesser in the world, especially on these matters: what people tell me, I
      know; and neither more not less."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont rejoiced in the simplicity of her companion. "Then, my good
      friend, it is but fair to tell you," said she, "that Amelia has an
      admirer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A lover, hey! Who?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, there's the misfortune; it is a thing I never can consent to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! then now it is out! There's the reason the girl blushes, and is so
      absent at times."
    </p>
    <p>
      A plan now occurred to Mrs. Beaumont's scheming imagination which she
      thought the master-piece of policy. She determined to account for whatever
      symptoms of embarrassment Mr. Palmer might observe in her daughter, by
      attributing them to a thwarted attachment for Sir John Hunter; and Mrs.
      Beaumont resolved to make a merit to Mr. Palmer of opposing this match
      because the lover was a baronet, and she thought that Mr. Palmer would be
      pleased by her showing an aversion to the thoughts of her daughter's
      marrying <i>a sprig of quality</i>. This ingenious method of paying her
      court to her open-hearted friend, at the expense equally of truth and of
      her daughter, she executed with her usual address.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm heartily glad, my dear good madam, to find that you have the
      same prejudices against sprigs of quality that I have. One good commoner
      is worth a million of them to my mind. So I told a puppy of a nephew of
      mine, who would go and buy a baronetage, forsooth&mdash;disinherited him!
      but he is dead, poor puppy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor young man! But this is all new to me," said Mrs. Beaumont, with
      well-feigned surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But did not you know, my dear madam, that I had a nephew, and that he is
      dead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes; but not the particulars."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; the particulars I never talk of&mdash;not to the poor dog's credit.
      It's well he's dead, for if he had lived, I am afraid I should have
      forgiven him. No, no, I never would. But there is no use in thinking any
      more of that. What were we saying? Oh, about your Amelia&mdash;our Amelia,
      let me call her. If she is so much attached, poor thing, to this man,
      though he is a baronet, which I own is against him to my fancy, yet it is
      to be presumed he has good qualities to balance that, since she values
      him; and young people must be young, and have their little foolish
      prepossessions for title, and so forth. To be sure, I should have thought
      my friend's daughter above that, of such a good family as she is, and with
      such good sense as she inherits too. But we have all our foibles, I
      suppose. And since it is so with Amelia, why do let me see this
      baronet-swain of hers, and let me try what good I can find out in him, and
      let me bring myself, if I can, over my prejudices. And then you, my dear
      madam, so good and kind a mother as you are, will make an effort too on
      your part; for we must see the girl happy, if it is not out of all sense
      and reason. And if the man be worthy of her, it is not his fault that he
      is a sprig of quality; and we must forgive and forget, and give our
      consent, my dear Mrs. Beaumont."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And would you ever give your consent to her marrying Sir John Hunter?"
      cried Mrs. Beaumont, breathless with amazement, and for a moment thrown
      off her guard so as to speak quite naturally. The sudden difference in her
      tone and manner struck even her unsuspicious companion, and he attributed
      it to displeasure at this last hint.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, my very dear good friend's wife, forgive me," said he, "for this
      interference, and for, as it seems, opposing your opinion about your
      daughter's marriage, which no man has a right to do&mdash;but if you ask
      me plump whether I could forgive her for marrying Sir John Hunter, I
      answer, for I can speak nothing but the truth, I would, if he is a worthy
      man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought," said Mrs. Beaumont, astonished, "you disinherited your own
      nephew, because he took a baronet's title against your will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless you! no, my dear madam&mdash;that did displease me, to be sure&mdash;but
      that was the least cause of displeasure I had. I let the world fancy and
      say what they would, rather than bring faults to light.&mdash;But no more
      about that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But did not you take an oath that you would never leave a shilling of
      your fortune to any <i>sprig of quality?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never! my dearest madam! never," cried Mr. Palmer, laughing. "Never was
      such a gander. See what oaths people put into one's mouth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what lies the world tells," said Mrs. Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And believes," said Mr. Palmer, with a sly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surprise that Mrs. Beaumont felt was mixed with a strange and rapid
      confusion of other sentiments, regret for having wasted such a quantity of
      contrivance and manoeuvring against an imaginary difficulty. All this
      arose from her too easy belief of <i>secret underhand information</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the maze of artifice in which she had involved affairs, she now,
      with some difficulty, perceived that plain truth would have served her
      purpose better. But regret for the past was not in the least mixed with
      any thing like remorse or penitence; on the contrary, she instantly began
      to consider how she could best profit by her own wrong. She thought she
      saw two of her favourite objects almost within her reach, Mr. Palmer's
      fortune, and the future title for her daughter: no obstacle seemed likely
      to oppose the accomplishment of her wishes, except Amelia's own
      inclinations: these she thought she could readily prevail upon her to give
      up; for she knew that her daughter was both of a timid and of an
      affectionate temper; that she had never in any instance withstood, or even
      disputed, her maternal authority; and that dread of her displeasure had
      often proved sufficient to make Amelia suppress or sacrifice her own
      feelings. Combining all these reflections with her wonted rapidity, Mrs.
      Beaumont determined what her play should now be. She saw, or thought she
      saw, that she ought, either by gentle or strong means, to lure or
      intimidate Amelia to her purpose; and that, while she carried on this part
      of the plot with her daughter in private, she should appear to Mr. Palmer
      to yield to his persuasions by degrees, to make the young people happy
      their own way, and to be persuaded reluctantly out of her aversion to <i>sprigs
      of quality</i>. To be sure, it would be necessary to give fresh
      explanations and instructions to Sir John Hunter, through his sister, with
      the new parts that he and she were to act in this domestic drama. As soon
      as Mrs. Beaumont returned from her airing, therefore, she retired to her
      own apartment, and wrote a note of explanation, with a proper proportion
      of sentiment and <i>verbiage,</i> to her dear Albina, begging to see her
      and Sir John Hunter the very next day. The horse, which had been lamed by
      the nail, now, of course, had recovered; and it was found by Mrs. Beaumont
      that she had been misinformed, and that he had been lamed only by sudden
      cramp. Any excuse she knew would be sufficient, in the present state of
      affairs, to the young lady, who was more ready to be deceived than even
      our heroine was disposed to deceive. Indeed, as Machiavel says, "as there
      are people willing to cheat, there will always be those who are ready to
      be cheated."

      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Vous m'enchantez, mais vous m'épouvantez; Ces pieges-là sont-ils bien
      ajustés? Craignez vous point de vous laisser surprendre Dans les filets
      que vos mains savent tendre?" VOLTAIRE.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prepare Amelia to receive Sir John Hunter <i>properly</i> was Mrs.
      Beaumont's next attempt; for as she had represented to Mr. Palmer that her
      daughter was attached to Sir John, it was necessary that her manner should
      in some degree accord with this representation, that at least it should
      not exhibit any symptoms of disapprobation or dislike: whatever coldness
      or reserve might appear, it would be easy to attribute to bashfulness and
      dread of Mr. Palmer's observation. When Amelia was undressing at night,
      her mother went into her room; and, having dismissed the maid, threw
      herself into an arm-chair, and exclaimed, half-yawning, "How tired I am!&mdash;No
      wonder, such a long airing as we took to-day. But, my dear Amelia, I could
      not sleep to-night without telling you how glad I am to find that you are
      such a favourite with Mr. Palmer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad he likes me," said Amelia; "I am sure I like him. What a
      benevolent, excellent man he seems to be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent, excellent&mdash;the best creature in the world!&mdash;And so
      interested about you! and so anxious that you should be well and soon
      established; almost as anxious about it as I am myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is very good&mdash;and you are very good, mamma; but there is no
      occasion that I should be <i>soon established</i>, as it is called&mdash;is
      there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the regular answer, you know, in these cases, from every young
      lady that ever was born, in or out of a book within the memory of man. But
      we will suppose all that to be said prettily on your part, and answered
      properly on mine: so give me leave to go on to something more to the
      purpose; and don't look so alarmed, my love. You know, I am not a hurrying
      person; you shall take your own time, and every thing shall be done as you
      like, and the whole shall be kept amongst ourselves entirely; for nothing
      is so disadvantageous and distressing to a young woman as to have these
      things talked of in the world long before they take place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, ma'am!&mdash;Surely there is no marriage determined upon for me,
      without my even knowing it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Determined upon!&mdash;Oh dear, no, my darling. You shall decide every
      thing for yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, mother; now you are kind indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indubitably, my dearest Amelia, I would not decide on any thing without
      consulting you: for I have the greatest dependence on your prudence and
      judgment. With a silly romantic girl, who had no discretion, I should
      certainly think it my duty to do otherwise; and if I saw my daughter
      following headlong some idle fancy of fifteen, I should interpose my
      authority at once, and say, It must not be. But I know my Amelia so well,
      that I am confident she will judge as prudently for herself as I could for
      her; and indeed, I am persuaded that our opinions will be now, as they
      almost always are, my sweet girl, the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so mamma&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, I'll allow a maidenly <i>but</i>&mdash;and you will allow
      that Sir John Hunter shall be the man at last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mamma, that can never be," said Amelia, with much earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Never</i>&mdash;A young lady's <i>never</i>, Amelia, I will allow too.
      Don't interrupt me, my dear&mdash;but give me leave to tell you again,
      that you shall have your own time&mdash;Mr. Palmer has given his consent
      and approbation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Consent and approbation!" cried Amelia. "And is it come to this? without
      even consulting me! And is this the way I am left to judge for myself?&mdash;Oh,
      mother! mother! what will become of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelia, who had long had experience that it was vain for her to attempt to
      counteract or oppose any scheme that her mother had planned, sat down at
      this instant in despair: but even from despair she took courage; and,
      rising suddenly, exclaimed, "I never can or will marry Sir John Hunter&mdash;for
      I love another person&mdash;mother, you know I do&mdash;and I will speak
      truth, and abide by it, let the consequences be what they may."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, don't speak so loud, at all events; for though it may be
      very proper to speak the truth, it is not necessary that the whole
      universe should hear it. You speak of another attachment&mdash;is it
      possible that you allude to Captain Walsingham? But Captain Walsingham has
      never proposed for you, nor even given you any reason to think he would;
      or if he has, he must have deceived me in the grossest manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is incapable of deceiving any body," said Amelia. "He never gave me
      any reason to think he would propose for me; nor ever made the slightest
      attempt to engage my affections. You saw his conduct: it was always
      uniform. He is incapable of any double or underhand practices."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the warmth of your eulogium on Captain Walsingham, you seem, Amelia,
      to forget that you reflect, in the most severe manner, upon yourself: for
      what woman, what young woman especially, who has either delicacy, pride,
      or prudence, can avow that she loves a man, who has never given, even by
      her own statement of the matter, the slightest reason to believe that he
      thinks of her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelia stood abashed, and for some instants incapable of reply: but at
      last, approaching her mother, and hiding her face, as she hung over her
      shoulder, she said, in a low and timid voice, "It was only to my mother&mdash;I
      thought that could not be wrong&mdash;and when it was to prevent a greater
      wrong, the engaging myself to another person."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Engaging yourself, my foolish child! but did I not tell you that you
      should have your own time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But no time, mother, will do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try, my dear love; that is all I ask of you; and this you cannot, in
      duty, in kindness, in prudence, or with decency, refuse me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cannot I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed you cannot. So say not a word more that can lessen the high
      opinion I have of you; but show me that you have a becoming sense of your
      own and of female dignity, and that you are not the poor, mean-spirited
      creature, to pine for a man who disdains you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Disdain! I never saw any disdain. On the contrary, though he never gave
      me reason to think so, I cannot help fancying&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That he likes you&mdash;and yet he never proposed for you! Do not believe
      it&mdash;a man may coquet as well as a woman, and often more; but till he
      makes his proposal, never, if you have any value for your own happiness or
      dignity, fancy for a moment that he loves you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he cannot marry, because he is so poor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True&mdash;and if so, what stronger argument can be brought against your
      thinking of him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not think of him&mdash;I endeavour not to think of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is my own girl! Depend upon it, he thinks not of you. He is all in
      his profession&mdash;prefers it to every woman upon earth. I have heard
      him say he would not give it up for any consideration. All for glory, you
      see; nothing for love."
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelia sighed. Her mother rose, and kissing her, said, as if she took
      every thing she wished for granted, "So, my Amelia, I am glad to see you
      reasonable, and ready to show a spirit that becomes you&mdash;Sir John
      Hunter breakfasts here to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Amelia, detaining her mother, who would have left the room, "I
      cannot encourage Sir John Hunter, for I do not esteem him; therefore I am
      sure I can never love him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot encourage Sir John Hunter, Amelia?" replied Mrs. Beaumont. "It
      is extraordinary that this should appear to you an impossibility the very
      moment the gentleman proposes for you. It was not always so. Allow me to
      remind you of a ball last year, where you and I met both Sir John Hunter
      and Captain Walsingham; as I remember, you gave all your attention that
      evening to Sir John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mother, I am ashamed of that evening&mdash;I regret it more than any
      evening of my life. I did wrong, very wrong; and bitterly have I suffered
      for it, as people always do, sooner or later, by deceit. I was afraid that
      you should see my real feelings; and, to conceal them, I, for the first
      and last time of my life, acted like a coquette. But if you recollect,
      dear mother, the very next day I confessed the truth to you. My friend,
      Miss Walsingham, urged me to have the courage to be sincere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Walsingham! On every occasion I find the secret influence of these
      Walsinghams operating in my family," cried Mrs. Beaumont, from a sudden
      impulse of anger, which threw her off her guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely their influence has always been beneficial to us all. To me, Miss
      Walsingham's friendship has been of the greatest service."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; by secretly encouraging you, against your mother's approbation, in a
      ridiculous passion for a man who neither can nor will marry you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Far from encouraging me, madam, in any thing contrary to your wishes&mdash;and
      far from wishing to do any thing secretly, Miss Walsingham never spoke to
      me on this subject but once; and that was to advise me strongly not to
      conceal the truth from you, and not to make use of any artifices or
      manoeuvres."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly, very possibly; but I presume you could conduct yourself
      properly without Miss Walsingham's interference or advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought, mamma, you liked Miss Walsingham particularly, and that you
      wished I should cultivate her friendship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly; I admire Miss Walsingham extremely, and wish to be on the best
      terms with the family; but I will never permit any one to interfere
      between me and my children. We should have gone on better without
      advisers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure her advice and friendship have preserved me from many faults,
      but never led me into any. I might, from timidity, and from fear of your
      superior address and abilities, have become insincere and artful; but she
      has given me strength of mind enough to bear the present evil, and to dare
      at all hazards to speak the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dearest Amelia," said Mrs. Beaumont, softening her tone, "why so
      warm? What object can your mother have but your good? Can any Miss
      Walsingham, or any other friend upon earth, have your interest so much at
      heart as I have? Why am I so anxious, if it is not from love to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelia was touched by her mother's looks and words of affection, and
      acknowledged that she had spoken with too much warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont thought she could make advantage of this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, my beloved child, if you are convinced of my affection for you,
      show at least some confidence in me in return: show some disposition to
      oblige me. Here is a match I approve; here is an establishment every way
      suitable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why, mamma, must I be married?" interrupted Amelia. "I will not
      think, at least I will try not to think, of any one of whom you do not
      approve; but I cannot marry any other man while I feel such a partiality
      for&mdash;. So, dear mother, pray do not let Sir John Hunter come here any
      more on my account. It is not necessary that I should marry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is necessary, however," said Mrs. Beaumont, withdrawing her hand
      haughtily, and darting a look of contempt and anger upon her daughter, "it
      is necessary, however, that I should be mistress in my own house, and that
      I should invite here whomever I please. And it is necessary that you
      should receive them without airs, and with politeness. On this, observe, I
      insist, and will be obeyed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont would receive no reply, but left the room seemingly in great
      displeasure: but even half her anger was affected, to intimidate this
      gentle girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John Hunter and his sister arrived to breakfast. Mrs. Beaumont played
      her part admirably; so that she seemed to Mr. Palmer only to be enduring
      Sir John from consideration for her daughter, and from compliance with Mr.
      Palmer's own request that she would try what could be done to make the
      young people happy; yet she, with infinite address, <i>drew Sir John out</i>,
      and dexterously turned every thing he said into what she thought would
      please Mr. Palmer, though all the time she seemed to be misunderstanding
      or confuting him. Mr. Palmer's attention, which was generally fixed
      exclusively on one object at a time, had ample occupation in studying Sir
      John, whom he examined, for Amelia's sake, with all the honest penetration
      which he possessed. Towards Amelia herself he scarcely ever looked; for,
      without any refinement of delicacy, he had sufficient feeling and sense to
      avoid what he thought would embarrass a young lady. Amelia's silence and
      reserve appeared to him, therefore, as her politic mother had foreseen,
      just what was natural and proper. He had been told that she was attached
      to Sir John Hunter; and the idea of doubting the truth of what Mrs.
      Beaumont had asserted could not enter his confiding mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time, our heroine, to whom the conduct of a double intrigue
      was by no means embarrassing, did not neglect the affairs of her dear
      Albina: she had found time before breakfast, as she met Miss Hunter
      getting out of her carriage, to make herself sure that her notes of
      explanation had been understood; and she now, by a multitude of scarcely
      perceptible inuendoes, and seemingly suppressed looks of pity, contrived
      to carry on the representation she had made to her son of this damsel's
      helpless and lovelorn state. Indeed, the young lady appeared as much in
      love as could have been desired for stage effect, and rather more than was
      necessary for propriety. All Mrs. Beaumont's art, therefore, was exerted
      to throw a veil of becoming delicacy over what might have been too
      glaring, by hiding half to improve the whole. Where there was any want of
      management on the part of her young coadjutrix, she, with exquisite skill,
      made advantage even of these errors by look? and sighs, that implied
      almost as emphatically as words could have said to her son&mdash;"You see
      what I told you is too true. The simple creature has not art enough to
      conceal her passion. She is undone in the eyes of the world, if you do not
      confirm what report has said."
    </p>
    <p>
      This she left to work its natural effect upon the vanity of man. And in
      the midst of these multiplied manoeuvres, Mrs. Beaumont sat with ease and
      unconcern, sometimes talking to one, sometimes to another; so that a
      stranger would have thought her a party uninterested in all that was going
      forward, and might have wondered at her blindness or indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, alas! notwithstanding her utmost art, she failed this day in turning
      and twisting Sir John Hunter's conversation and character so as to make
      them agreeable to Mr. Palmer. This she knew by his retiring at an early
      hour at night, as he sometimes did when company was not agreeable to him.
      His age gave him this privilege. Mrs. Beaumont followed, to inquire if he
      would not wish to <i>take something</i> before he went to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. George, Madam Beaumont, you are right," said Mr. Palmer, "you are
      right, in not liking this baronet. I'm tired of him&mdash;sick of him&mdash;can't
      like him!&mdash;sorry for it, since Amelia likes him. But what can a
      daughter of Colonel Beaumont find in this man to be pleased with? He is a
      baronet, to be sure, but that is all. Tell me, my good madam, what it is
      the girl likes in him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont could only answer by an equivocal smile, and a shrug, that
      seemed to say&mdash;there's no accounting for these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear madam," pursued Mr. Palmer, "the man is neither handsome nor
      young: he is old enough for her father, though he gives himself the airs
      of a youngster; and his manners are&mdash;I can allow for fashionable
      manners. But, madam, it is his character I don't like&mdash;selfish&mdash;cold&mdash;designing&mdash;not
      a generous thought, not a good feeling about him. You are right, madam,
      quite right. In all his conversation such meanness, and even in what he
      means for wit, such a contempt of what is fair and honourable! Now that
      fellow does not believe that such a thing as virtue or patriotism, honour
      or friendship, exists. The jackanapes!&mdash;and as for love! why, madam,
      I'm convinced he is no more in love with the girl than I am, nor so much,
      ma'am, nor half so much!&mdash;does not feel her merit, does not value her
      accomplishments, does not Madam! madam! he is thinking of nothing but
      himself, and her fortune&mdash;fortune! fortune! fortune! that's all. The
      man's a miser. Madam, they that know no better fancy that there are none
      but old misers; but I can tell them there are young misers, and
      middle-aged misers, and misers of all ages. They say such a man can't be a
      miser, because he is a spendthrift; but, madam, you know a man can be both&mdash;yes,
      and that's what many of your young men of fashion are, and what, I'll
      engage, this fellow is. And can Amelia like him? my poor child! and does
      she think he loves her? my poor, poor child! how can she be so blind? but
      love is always blind, they say. I've a great mind to take her to task, and
      ask her, between ourselves, what it is she likes in her baronet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear sir! she would sink to the centre of the earth if you were to
      speak. For Heaven's sake, don't take her to task, foolish as she is;
      besides, she would be so angry with me for telling you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Angry? the gipsy! Am not I her godfather and her guardian? though I could
      not act, because I was abroad, yet her guardian I was left by her father,
      and love her too as well as I should a daughter of her father's&mdash;and
      she to have secrets, and mysteries! that would be worse than all the rest,
      for mysteries are what I abhor. Madam, wherever there are secrets and
      mysteries in a family, take my word for it, there is somethings wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, my dear sir; but Amelia has no idea of mysteries or art. I only
      meant that young girls, you know, will be ashamed on these occasions, and
      we must make allowances. So do not speak to her, I conjure you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, madam, you are her mother, and must know best. I have only her
      interest at heart: but I won't speak to her, since it will so distress
      her. But what shall be done about this lover? You are quite right about
      him, and I have not a word more to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I declare I think you judge him too harshly. Though I am not inclined
      to be his friend, yet I must do him the justice to say, he has more good
      qualities than you allow, or rather than you have seen yet. He is
      passionately fond of Amelia. Oh, there you're wrong, quite wrong; he is
      passionately in love, whatever he may pretend to the contrary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretend! and why should the puppy pretend not to be in love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pride, pride and fashion. Young men are so governed by fashion, and so
      afraid of ridicule. There's a set of <i>fashionables</i> now, with whom
      love is a <i>bore, </i>you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know! no, indeed, I know no such thing," said Mr. Palmer. "But this I
      know, that I hate pretences of all sorts; and if the man is in love, I
      should, for my part, like him the better for showing it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he will, when you know him a little better. You are quite a stranger,
      and he is bashful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bashful! Never saw so confident a man in any country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he is shy under all that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Under! But I don't like characters where every thing is under something
      different from what appears at top."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, take a day or two more to study him. Though I am his enemy, I must
      deal fairly by him, for poor Amelia's sake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a good mother, madam, an indulgent mother, and I honour and love
      you for it. I'll follow your example, and bear with this
      spendthrift-miser-coxcomb sprig of quality for a day or two more, and try
      to like him, for Amelia's sake. But, if he's not worthy of her, he sha'n't
      have her, by St. George, he shall not&mdash;shall he, madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, no; good night, my good sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      What the manoeuvres of the next day might have effected, and how far Sir
      John Hunter profited by the new instructions which were given to him in
      consequence of this conversation, can never be accurately ascertained,
      because the whole united plan of operations was disturbed by a new and
      unforeseen event.

      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Un volto senza senno, Un petto senza core, un cor senz' alma, Un' alma
      senza fede." GUARINI.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's glorious news of Captain Walsingham!" cried young Beaumont; "I
      always knew he would distinguish himself if he had an opportunity; and,
      thank God! he has had as fine an opportunity as heart could wish. Here,
      mother! here, Mr. Palmer, is an account of it in this day's paper! and
      here is a letter from himself, which Mr. Walsingham has just sent me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, give <i>me</i> the letter," cried Mrs. Beaumont, with affected
      eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me have the paper, then," cried Mr. Palmer. "Where are my
      spectacles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are there any letters for <i>me?</i>" said Sir John Hunter. "Did my
      newspapers come? Albina, I desired that they should be forwarded here.
      Mrs. Beaumont, can you tell me any thing of <i>my</i> papers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Amelia, how interesting your brother looks when he is pleased!"
      Albina whispered, quite loud enough to be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A most gallant action, by St. George!" exclaimed Mr. Palmer. "These are
      the things that keep up the honour of the British navy, and the glory of
      Britain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This Spanish ship that Captain Walsingham captured the day after the
      engagement is likely to turn out a valuable prize, too," said Mrs.
      Beaumont. "I am vastly glad to find this by his letter, for the money will
      be useful to him, he wanted it so much. He does not say how much his share
      will come to, does he, Edward?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, ma'am: you see he writes in a great hurry, and he has only time, as
      he says, to mention <i>the needful</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is not the money <i>the needful?</i>" said Sir John Hunter, with a
      splenetic smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With Walsingham it is only a secondary consideration," replied Beaumont;
      "honour is Captain Walsingham's first object. I dare say he has never yet
      calculated what his prize-money will be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right, right!" reiterated Mr. Palmer; "then he is the right sort. Long
      may it be before our naval officers think more of prize-money than of
      glory! Long may it be before our honest tars turn into calculating
      pirates!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They never will or can whilst they have such officers as Captain
      Walsingham," said Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. George, he seems to be a fine fellow, and you a warm friend," said
      Mr. Palmer. "Ay, ay, the colonel's own son. But why have I never seen any
      of these Walsinghams since I came to the country? Are they ashamed of
      being related to me, because I am a merchant?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More likely they are too proud to pay court to you because you are so
      rich," said Mr. Beaumont. "But they did come to see you, sir,&mdash;the
      morning you were out so late, mother, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, ay, true&mdash;how unfortunate!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But have not we horses? have not we carriages? have not we legs?" said
      Mr. Palmer. "I'll go and see these Walsinghams to-morrow, please God I
      live so long: for I am proud of my relationship to this young hero; and I
      won't be cast off by good people, let them be as proud as they will&mdash;that's
      their fault&mdash;but I will not stand on idle ceremony: so, my good
      Mistress Beaumont, we will all go in a body, and storm their castle
      to-morrow morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An admirable plan! I like it of all things!" said Mrs. Beaumont. "How
      few, even in youth, are so active and enthusiastic as our good friend!
      But, my dear Mr. Palmer&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I wish I could see the captain himself. Is there any chance of his
      coming home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Home! yes," said Beaumont: "did you not read his letter, sir? here it is;
      he will be at home directly. He says, 'perhaps a few hours after this
      letter reaches you, you'll see me.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "See him! Odds my life, I'm glad of it. And you, my little Amelia," said
      Mr. Palmer, tapping her shoulders as she stood with her back to him
      reading the newspaper; "and you, my little silent one, not one word have I
      heard from you all this time. Does not some spark of your father's spirit
      kindle within you on hearing of this heroic relation of ours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Luckily for the ladies, sir," said Sir John Hunter, coming up, as he
      thought, to the lady's assistance&mdash;"luckily for young ladies, sir,
      they are not called upon to be heroes; and it would be luckier still for
      us men, if they never set themselves up for heroines&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!
      Miss Beaumont," continued he, "the shower is over; I'll order the horses
      out, that we may have our ride." Sir John left the room, evidently pleased
      with his own wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amelia, my love," said Mrs. Beaumont, who drew up also to give assistance
      at this critical juncture, "go, this moment, and write a note to your
      friend Miss Walsingham, to say that we shall all be with them early
      to-morrow: I will send a servant directly, that we may be sure to meet
      with them at home this time; you'll find pen, ink, and paper in my
      dressing-room, love."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont drew Amelia's arm within hers, and, dictating kindest
      messages for the Walsinghams, led her out of the loom. Having thus
      successfully covered her daughter's retreat, our skilful manoeuvrer
      returned, all self-complacent, to the company. And next, to please the
      warm-hearted Mr. Palmer, she seemed to sympathize in his patriotic
      enthusiasm for the British navy: she pronounced a panegyric on the <i>young
      hero,</i> Captain Walsingham, which made the good old man rub his hands
      with exultation, and which irradiated with joy the countenance of her son.
      But, alas! Mrs. Beaumont's endeavours to please, or rather to dupe all
      parties, could not, even with her consummate address, always succeed:
      though she had an excellent memory, and great presence of mind, with
      peculiar quickness both of eye and ear, yet she could not always register,
      arrange, and recollect all that was necessary for the various parts she
      undertook to act. Scarcely had she finished her eulogium on Captain
      Walsingham, when, to her dismay, she saw close behind her Sir John Hunter,
      who had entered the room without her perceiving it. He said not one word;
      but his clouded brow showed his suspicions, and his extreme displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Beaumont," said he, after some minutes' silence, "I find I must have
      the honour of wishing you a good morning, for I have an indispensable
      engagement at home to dinner to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought, Sir John, you and Amelia were going to ride?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ma'am, Miss Beaumont does not choose to ride&mdash;she told me, so this
      instant as I passed her on the stairs. Oh! don't disturb her, I beg&mdash;she
      is writing to Miss Walsingham&mdash;I have the honour to wish you a good
      morning, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if you are determined to go, let me say three words to you in the
      music-room, Sir John: though," added she, in a whisper intended to be
      heard by Mr. Palmer, "I know you do not look upon me as your friend, yet
      depend upon it I shall treat you and all the world with perfect candour."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John, though sulky, could not avoid following the lady; and as soon as
      she had shut all the doors and double-doors of the music-room, she
      exclaimed, "It is always best to speak openly to one's friends. Now, my
      dear Sir John Hunter, how can you be so childish as to take ill of me what
      I really was forced to say, for <i>your</i> interest, about Captain
      Walsingham, to Mr. Palmer? You know old Palmer is the oddest, most
      self-willed man imaginable! humour and please him I must, the few days he
      is with me. You know he goes on Tuesday&mdash;that's decided&mdash;Dr.
      Wheeler has seen him, has talked to him about his health, and it is
      absolutely necessary that he should return to the West Indies. Then he is
      perfectly determined to leave all he has to Amelia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, ma'am; but how am I sure of being the better for that?" interrupted
      Sir John, whose decided selfishness was a match for Mrs. Beaumont's
      address, because it went without scruple or ceremony straight to his
      object; "for, ma'am, you can't think I'm such a fool as not to see that
      Mr. Palmer wishes me at the devil. Miss Beaumont gives me no
      encouragement; and you, ma'am, I know, are too good a politician to offend
      Mr. Palmer: so, if he declares in favour of this young <i>hero,</i>
      Captain Walsingham, I may quit the field."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you don't consider that Mr. Palmer's young hero has never made any
      proposal for Amelia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw! ma'am&mdash;but I know, as well as you do, that he likes her, and
      propose he will for her now that he has money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Granting that; you forget that all this takes time, and that Palmer will
      be gone to the West Indies before they can bring out their proposal; and
      as soon as he is gone, and has left his will, as he means to do, with me,
      you and I have the game in our own hands. It is very extraordinary to me
      that you do not seem to understand my play, though I explained the whole
      to Albina; and I thought she had made you comprehend the necessity for my
      <i>seeming,</i> for this one week, to be less your friend than I could
      wish, because of your title, and that odd whim of Palmer, you know: but I
      am sure we understand one another now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me," said the invincible Sir John: "I confess, Mrs. Beaumont, you
      have so much more abilities, and <i>finesse</i>, and all that sort of
      thing, than I have, that I cannot help being afraid of&mdash;of not
      understanding the business rightly. In business there is nothing like
      understanding one another, and going on sure grounds. There has been so
      much going backwards and forwards, and explanations and manoeuvres, that I
      am not clear how it is; nor do I feel secure even that I have the honour
      of your approbation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! not when I have assured you of it, Sir John, in the most
      unequivocal manner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was singular that the only person to whom in this affair Mrs. Beaumont
      spoke the real truth should not believe her. Sir John Hunter continued
      obstinately suspicious and incredulous. He had just heard that his uncle
      Wigram, his rich uncle Wigram, was taken ill, and not likely to recover.
      This intelligence had also reached Mrs. Beaumont, and she was anxious to
      secure the baronet and the Wigram fortune for her daughter; but nothing
      she could say seemed to satisfy him that she was not double-dealing. At
      last, to prove to him her sincerity, she gave him what he required, and
      what alone, he said, could make his mind easy, could bring him to make up
      his mind&mdash;<i>a written assurance</i> of her approbation of his
      addresses to Amelia. With this he was content; "for," said he, "what is
      written remains, and there can be no misunderstandings in future, or
      changing of minds."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was agreed between these confidential friends, that Sir John should
      depart, <i>as it were</i>, displeased; and she begged that he would not
      return till Mr. Palmer should have left the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there was a numerous tribe of <i>hangers-on</i>, who were in the habit
      of frequenting Beaumont Park, whom Mrs. Beaumont loved to see at her
      house; because, besides making her feel her own importance, they were
      frequently useful to carry on the subordinate parts of her perpetual
      manoeuvres. Among these secondary personages who attended Mrs. Beaumont
      abroad to increase her consequence in the eyes of common spectators, and
      who at home filled the stage, and added to the bustle and effect, her
      chief favourites were Mr. Twigg (the same gentleman who was deputed to
      decide upon the belt or the screen) and Captain Lightbody. Mr. Twigg was
      the most, elegant flatterer of the two, but Captain Lightbody was the most
      assured, and upon the whole made his way the best. He was a handsome man,
      had a good address, could tell a good story, sing a good song, and <i>make
      things go off</i> well, when there was company; so that he was a
      prodigious assistance to the mistress of the house. Then he danced with
      the young ladies when they had no other partners; he mounted guard
      regularly beside the piano-forte, or the harp, when the ladies were
      playing; and at dinner it was always the etiquette for him to sit beside
      Miss Beaumont, or Miss Hunter, when the gentlemen guests were not such as
      Mrs. Beaumont thought entitled to that honour, or such as she deemed <i>safe</i>
      companions. These arrangements imply that Captain Lightbody thought
      himself in Mrs. Beaumont's confidence: and so he was to a certain degree,
      just enough to flatter him into doing her high or low behests. Whenever
      she had a report to circulate, or to contradict, Captain Lightbody was put
      in play; and no man could be better calculated for this purpose, both from
      his love of talking, and of locomotion. He galloped about from place to
      place, and from one great house to another; knew all the lords and ladies,
      and generals and colonels, and brigade-majors and aides-de-camp, in the
      land. Could any mortal be better qualified to fetch and carry news for
      Mrs. Beaumont? Besides news, it was his office to carry compliments, and
      to speed the intercourse, not perhaps from soul to soul, but from house to
      house, which is necessary in a visiting country to keep up the character
      of an agreeable neighbour. Did Mrs. Beaumont forget to send a card of
      invitation, or neglect to return a visit, Lightbody was to set it to
      rights for her, Lightbody, the ready bearer of pretty notes, the maker
      always, the fabricator sometimes, of the civilest speeches imaginable.
      This expert speechifier, this ever idle, ever busy scamperer, our heroine
      dispatched to engage a neighbouring family to pay her a morning visit the
      next day, just about the time which was fixed for her going to see the
      Walsinghams. The usual caution was given. "Pray, Lightbody, do not let my
      name be used; do not let me be mentioned; but take it upon yourself, and
      say, as if from yourself, that you have reason to believe I take it ill
      that they have not been here lately. And then you can mention the hour
      that would be most convenient. But let me have nothing to do with it. I
      must not appear in it on any account."
    </p>
    <p>
      In consequence of Captain Lightbody's faithful execution of his secret
      instructions, a barouche full of morning visitors drove to the door, just
      at the time when Mrs. Beaumont had proposed to set out for Walsingham
      House. Mrs. Beaumont, with a well-dissembled look of vexation, exclaimed,
      as she looked out of the window at the carriage, "How provoking! Who can
      these people be? I hope Martin will say I am not at home. Ring&mdash;ring,
      Amelia. Oh, it's too late, they have seen me! and Martin, stupid creature!
      has let them in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Palmer was much discomfited, and grew more and more impatient when
      these troublesome visitors protracted their stay, and proposed a walk to
      see some improvements in the grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my good Mistress Beaumont," said he, "you know we are engaged to our
      cousin Walsingham this morning; and if you will give me leave, I will go
      on before you with Mr. Beaumont, and we can say what detains you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Disconcerted by this simple determination of this straight-forward,
      plain-spoken old gentleman, Mrs. Beaumont saw that farther delay on her
      part would be not only inefficacious, but dangerous. She now was eager to
      be relieved from the difficulties which she had herself contrived. She
      would not, for any consideration, have trusted Mr. Palmer to pay this
      visit without her: therefore, by an able counter-movement, she extricated
      herself not only without loss, but with advantage, from this perilous
      situation. She made a handsome apology to her visitors for being obliged
      to run away from them. "She would leave Amelia to have the pleasure of
      showing them the grounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont was irresistible in her arrangements. Amelia, disappointed
      and afraid to show how deeply she felt the disappointment, was obliged to
      stay to do the honours of Beaumont Park, whilst her mother drove off
      rejoicing in half the success, at least, of her stratagem; but even as a
      politician she used upon every occasion too much artifice. It was said of
      Cardinal Mazarin, he is a great politician, but in all his politics there
      is one capital defect&mdash;"<i>C'est qu'il veut toujours tromper</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How tiresome those people were! I thought we never should have got away
      from them," said Mrs. Beaumont. "What possessed them to come this morning,
      and to pay such a horrid long visit? Besides, those Duttons, at all times,
      are the most stupid creatures upon the face of the earth; I cannot endure
      them; so awkward and ill-bred too! and yet of a good family&mdash;who
      could think it? They are people one must see, but they are absolutely
      insufferable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Insufferable!" said Mr. Palmer; "why, my good madam, then you have the
      patience of a martyr; for you suffered them so patiently, that I never
      should have guessed you suffered at all. I protest I thought they were
      friends and favourites of yours, and that you were very glad to see them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, 'tis the way of the world," continued Mr. Palmer; "this sort
      of&mdash;what do you call it? double-dealing about visitors, goes on every
      where, Madam Beaumont. But how do I know, that when I go away, you may not
      be as glad to get rid of me as you were to get away from these Duttons?"
      added he, in a tone of forced jocularity. "How do I know, but that the
      minute my back is turned, you may not begin to take me to pieces in my
      turn, and say, 'That old Palmer! he was the most tiresome, humoursome,
      strange, old-fashioned fellow; I thought we should never have got rid of
      him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, dear sir, how can you speak in such a manner?" cried Mrs.
      Beaumont, who had made several vain attempts to interrupt this speech.
      "You, who are our best friend! is it possible you could suspect? Is there
      no difference to be made between friends and common acquaintance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure I hope there is," said Mr. Palmer, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something so near the truth in Mr. Palmer's raillery, that Mrs.
      Beaumont could not take it with as much easy unconcern as the occasion
      required, especially in the presence of her son, who maintained a
      provoking silence. Unhappy indeed are those, who cannot, in such moments
      of distress, in their own families, and in their nearest connexions, find
      any relief from their embarrassments, and who look round in vain for one
      to be <i>responsible</i> for their sincerity. Mrs. Beaumont sat uneasy and
      almost disconcerted. Mr. Palmer felt for his snuff-box, his usual
      consolation; but it was not in his pocket: he had left it on his table.
      Now Mrs. Beaumont was relieved, for she had something to do, and something
      to say with her wonted politeness: in spite of all remonstrance from Mr.
      Palmer, her man Martin was sent back for the snuff-box; and conjectures
      about his finding it, and his being able to overtake them before they
      arrived at Walsingham house, supplied conversation for a mile or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's Martin coming back full gallop, I vow," said Miss Hunter, who
      could also talk on this topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, my good lady," said Mr. Palmer, (taking the moment when the
      young lady had turned her back as she stretched out of the carriage for
      the pleasure of seeing Martin gallop)&mdash;"Come, come, my good Mrs.
      Beaumont, shake hands and be friends, and hang the Duttons! I did not mean
      to vex you by what I said. I am not so polite as I should be, I know, and
      you perhaps are a little too polite. But that is no great harm, especially
      in a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin and the snuff-box came up at this instant; and all was apparently
      as well as ever. Yet Mrs. Beaumont, who valued a reputation for sincerity
      as much as Chartres valued a reputation for honesty, and nearly upon the
      same principle, was seriously vexed that even this transient light had
      been let in upon her real character. To such <i>accidents</i> duplicity is
      continually subject.

      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Led by Simplicity divine, She pleased, and never tried to shine; She gave
      to chance each unschool'd feature, And left her cause to sense and
      nature."&mdash;MORE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at Walsingham Park, they met Miss Walsingham walking at some
      distance from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Captain Walsingham come?" was the first question asked. "No, but
      expected every hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      That he had not actually arrived was a comfortable reprieve to Mrs.
      Beaumont. Breathing more freely, and in refreshed spirits, she prepared to
      alight from her carriage, to walk to the house with Miss Walsingham, as
      Mr. Palmer proposed. Miss Hunter, who was dressed with uncommon elegance,
      remonstrated in favour of her delicate slippers: not that she named the
      real object of her solicitude&mdash;no; she had not spent so much time
      with Mrs. Beaumont, that great mistress of the art of apologizing, without
      learning at least the inferior practices of the trade. Of course she had
      all the little common arts of excuse ever ready: and instead of saying
      that she did not like to walk because she was afraid to spoil her shoes,
      she protested she was afraid of the heat, and could not walk so far. But
      Mr. Beaumont had jumped out of the carriage, and Mrs. Beaumont did not
      wish that he should walk home <i>tête-à-tête</i> with Miss Walsingham;
      therefore Miss Hunter's remonstrances were of no avail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My love, you, will not be heated, for our walk is through this charming
      shady grove; and if you are tired, here's my son will give you his arm."
    </p>
    <p>
      Satisfied with this arrangement, the young lady, thus supported, found it
      possible to walk. Mr. Palmer walked his own pace, looking round at the
      beauties of the place, and desiring that nobody might mind him. This was
      his way, and Mrs. Beaumont never teased him with talking to him, when he
      did not seem to be in the humour for it. She, who made something of every
      thing, began to manage the conversation with her other companions during
      the walk, so as to favour her views upon the several parties. Pursuing her
      principle, that love is in men's minds generally independent of esteem,
      and believing that her son might be rendered afraid of the superiority of
      Miss Walsingham's understanding, Mrs. Beaumont took treacherous pains to
      <i>draw her out</i>. Starting from chance seemingly, as she well knew how,
      a subject of debate, she went from talking of the late marriage of some
      neighbouring couple, to discuss a question on which she believed that Miss
      Walsingham's opinion would differ from that of her son. The point was,
      whether a wife should or should not have pin-money. Miss Walsingham
      thought that a wife's accepting it would tend to establish a separate
      interest between married people. Mr. Beaumont, on the contrary, was of
      opinion, that a wife's having a separate allowance would prevent disputes.
      So Miss Hunter thought, of course, for she had been prepared to be
      precisely of Mr. Beaumont's opinion; but reasons she had none in its
      support. Indeed, she said with a pretty simper, she thought that women had
      nothing to do with reason or reasoning; that she thought a woman who
      really loved <i>any body</i> was always of that person's opinion; and
      especially in a wife she did not see of what use reasoning and <i>all that</i>
      could be, except to make a woman contradict, and be odd, and fond of
      ruling: that for her part she had no pretensions to any understanding, and
      if she had ever so much, she should be glad, she declared upon her honour,
      to get rid of it if she could; for what use could it possibly be of to
      her, when it must be the husband's understanding that must always judge
      and rule, and a wife ought only to obey, and be always of the opinion of
      the man of her choice?&mdash;Having thus made her profession of folly in
      broken sentences, with pretty confusion and all-becoming graces, she
      leaned upon Mr. Beaumont's arm with a bewitching air of languid delicacy,
      that solicited support. Mrs. Beaumont, suppressing a sigh, which, however,
      she took care that her son should hear, turned to Miss Walsingham, and, in
      a whisper, owned that she could not help loving abilities, and spirit too,
      even in her own sex. Then she observed aloud, that much might be urged on
      her side of the question with regard to pin-money; for not only, as Miss
      Walsingham justly said, it might tend to make a separate interest between
      husband and wife, but the wife would probably be kept in total ignorance
      of her husband's affairs; and <i>that</i> in some cases might be very
      disadvantageous, as some women are more capable, from their superior
      understanding, of managing every thing than most men, indeed, than any man
      she could name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even under favour of this pretty compliment, which was plainly directed by
      a glance of Mrs. Beaumont's eye, Miss Walsingham would not accept of this
      painful pre-eminence. She explained and made it clear, that she had not
      any ambition to rule or manage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I can readily believe," said Mr. Beaumont; "for I have observed,
      that it is not always the women who are the most able to decide who are
      the most ambitious to govern."
    </p>
    <p>
      This observation either was not heard or was not understood by Miss
      Hunter, whose whole soul was occupied in settling some fold of her
      drapery: but Mr. Beaumont's speech had its full effect on Mrs. Beaumont,
      who bit her lip, and looked reproachfully at her son, as if she thought
      this an infringement of his promised truce. A moment afterwards she felt
      the imprudence of her own reproachful look, and was sensible that she
      would have done better not to have fixed the opinion or feeling in her
      son's mind by noticing it thus with displeasure. Recovering, herself, for
      she never was disconcerted for more than half a minute, she passed on with
      easy grace to discuss the merits of the heroine of some new novel&mdash;an
      historic novel, which gave her opportunity of appealing to Miss Walsingham
      on some disputed points of history. She dexterously attempted to draw her
      <i>well-informed</i> young friend into a display of literature which might
      alarm Mr. Beaumont. His education had in some respects been shamefully
      neglected; for his mother had calculated that ignorance would ensure
      dependence. He had endeavoured to supply, at a late period of his
      education, the defects of its commencement; but he was sensible that he
      had not supplied all his deficiencies, and he was apt to feel, with
      painful impatient sensibility, his inferiority, whenever literary subjects
      were introduced. Miss Walsingham, however, was so perfectly free from all
      the affectation and vanity of a bel-esprit, that she did not alarm even
      those who were inferior to her in knowledge; their self-complacency,
      instead of being depressed by the comparison of their attainments with
      hers, was insensibly raised, by the perception that notwithstanding these,
      she could take pleasure in their conversation, could appreciate their good
      sense or originality of thought, without recurring to the authority of
      books, or of great names. In fact, her mind had never been overwhelmed by
      a wasteful torrent of learning. That the stream of literature had passed
      over, it was apparent only from its fertility. Mrs. Beaumont repented of
      having drawn her into conversation. Indeed, our heroine had trusted too
      much to some expressions, which had at times dropped from her son, about
      <i>learned ladies</i>, and certain <i>conversaziones</i>. She had
      concluded that he would never endure literature in a wife; but she now
      perceived her mistake. She discerned it too late; and at this moment she
      was doubly vexed, for she saw Miss Hunter <i>produce</i> herself in most
      disadvantageous contrast to her rival. In conformity to instructions,
      which Mrs. Beaumont had secretly given her, not to show too much sense or
      learning, because gentlemen in general, and in particular Mr. Beaumont,
      disliked it; this young lady now professed absolute ignorance and
      incapacity upon all subjects; and meaning to have an air of pretty
      childish innocence or timidity, really made herself appear quite like a
      simpleton. At the same time a tinge of ineffectual malice and envy
      appeared through her ill-feigned humility. She could give no opinion of
      any book&mdash;oh, she would not give any judgment for the whole world!
      She did not think herself qualified to speak, even if she had read the
      book, which indeed she had not, for, really, she never read&mdash;she was
      not a <i>reading lady</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Miss Hunter had no portion of Mrs. Beaumont's quick penetration, she
      did not see the unfavourable impression these words made: certain that she
      was following exactly her secret instructions, she was confident of being
      in the right line; so on she went, whilst Mrs. Beaumont sighed in vain;
      and Miss Walsingham, who now saw and understood her whole play, almost
      smiled at the comic of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O dear, Mrs. Beaumont," continued Miss Hunter, "how can you ever appeal
      to me about books and those sorts of things, when you know I know nothing
      about the matter? For mercy's sake, never do so any more, for you know
      I've no taste for those sorts of things. And besides, I own, even if I
      could, I should so hate to be thought a blue-stocking&mdash;I would not
      have the least bit of blue in my stockings for the whole world&mdash;I'd
      rather have any other colour, black, white, red, green, yellow, any other
      colour. So I own I'm not sorry I'm not what they call a genius; for though
      genius to be sure's a very fascinating sort of thing in gentlemen, yet in
      women it is not so becoming, I think, especially in ladies: it does very
      well on the stage, and for artists, and so on; but really now, in company,
      I think it's an awkward thing, and would make one look so odd! Now, Mr.
      Beaumont, I must tell you an anecdote&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop, my dear Miss Hunter, your ear-ring is coming out. Stay! let me
      clasp it, love!" exclaimed Mrs. Beaumont, determined to stop her in the
      career of nonsense, by giving her sensations, since she could not give her
      ideas, a new turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, ma'am! ma'am! Oh! my ear! you are killing me, dearest Mrs. Beaumont!
      pinching me to death, ma'am!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I pinch, my dear? It was the hinge of the ear-ring, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what it was; but here's blood, I declare!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My love, I beg you a thousand pardons. How could I be so awkward! But why
      could not you for one moment hold your little head still?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Walsingham applied a patch to the wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a pretty ear as it is," continued Mrs. Beaumont; "I am sure it was a
      pity to hurt it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You really did hurt it," said Mr. Beaumont, in a tone of compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, horridly!" cried Miss Hunter&mdash;"and I, that always faint at the
      sight of blood!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Afraid that the young lady would again spoil her part in the acting, and
      lose all the advantages which might result from the combined effect of the
      pretty ear and of compassion, Mrs. Beaumont endeavoured to take off her
      attention from the wound, by attacking her ear-rings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My love," said she, "don't wear these ear-rings any more, for I assure
      you there is no possibility of shutting or opening them, without hurting
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      This expedient, however, nearly proved fatal in its consequences. Miss
      Hunter entered most warmly into the defence of her ear-rings; and appealed
      to Mr. Beaumont to confirm her decision, that they were the prettiest and
      best ear-rings in the world. Unluckily, they did not particularly suit his
      fancy, and the young lady, who had, but half an hour before, professed
      that she could never be of a different opinion in any thing from that of
      the man she loved, now pettishly declared that she could not and would not
      give up her taste. Incensed still more by a bow of submission, but not of
      conviction, from Mr. Beaumont, she went on regardless of her dearest Mrs.
      Beaumont's frowns, and vehemently maintained her judgment, quoting, with
      triumphant volubility, innumerable precedents of ladies, "who had just
      bought <i>the very same</i> ear-rings, and whose taste she believed nobody
      would dispute."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaumont had seen enough, now and upon many other occasions, to be
      convinced that it is not on matters of consequence that ladies are apt to
      grow most angry; and he stood confirmed in his belief that those who in
      theory professed to have such a humble opinion of their own abilities that
      they cannot do or understand any thing useful, are often, in practice, the
      most prone to insist upon the infallibility of their taste and judgment.
      Mrs. Beaumont, who saw with one glance of her quick eye what passed at
      this moment in her son's mind, sighed, and said to herself&mdash;"How
      impossible to manage a fool, who ravels, as fast as one weaves, the web of
      her fortune!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet though Mrs. Beaumont perceived and acknowledged the impracticability
      of managing a fool for a single hour, it was one of the favourite objects
      of her manoeuvres to obtain this very fool for a daughter-in-law, with the
      hope of governing her for life. So inconsistent are cunning people, even
      of the best abilities; so ill do they calculate the value of their
      ultimate objects, however ingeniously they devise their means, or adapt
      them to their ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this walk Mr. Palmer had taken no part in the conversation; he had
      seemed engrossed with his own thoughts, or occupied with observing the
      beauties of the place. Tired with her walk&mdash;for Mrs. Beaumont always
      complained of being fatigued when she was vexed, thus at once concealing
      her vexation, and throwing the faults of her mind upon her body&mdash;she
      stretched herself upon a sofa as soon as she reached the house, nor did
      she recover from her exhausted state till she cast her eyes upon a
      tamborine, which she knew would afford means of showing Miss Hunter's
      figure and graces to advantage. Slight as this resource may seem, Mrs.
      Beaumont well knew that slighter still have often produced great effects.
      Soon afterward she observed her son smile repeatedly as he read a passage
      in some book that lay upon the table, and she had the curiosity to take up
      the book when he turned away. She found that it was Cumberland's Memoirs,
      and saw the following little poem marked with reiterated lines of
      approbation:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Affectation, why this mock grimace? Go, silly thing, and hide that
      simp'ring face. Thy lisping prattle, and thy mincing gait, All thy false
      mimic fooleries I hate; For thou art Folly's counterfeit, and she Who is
      right foolish hath the better plea; Nature's true idiot I prefer to thee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why that soft languish? Why that drawling tone? Art sick, art sleepy? Get
      thee hence: begone. I laugh at all thy pretty baby tears, Those
      flutt'rings, faintings, and unreal fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can they deceive us? Can such mumm'ries move, Touch us with pity, or
      inspire with love? No, Affectation, vain is all thy art! Those eyes may
      wander over ev'ry part; They'll never find their passage to the heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont, the moment she had read these lines, perceived why her son
      had smiled. The portrait seemed really to have been drawn from Miss
      Hunter, and the lines were so <i>à propos</i> to the scene which had just
      passed during the walk, that it was impossible to avoid the application.
      Mrs. Beaumont shut the book hastily as her dear Albina approached, for she
      was afraid that the young lady would have known her own picture. So few
      people, however, even of those much wiser than Miss Hunter, know
      themselves, that she need not have been alarmed. But she had no longer
      leisure to devote her thoughts to this subject, for Mr. Walsingham, who
      had been out riding, had by this time returned; and the moment he entered
      the room, Mrs. Beaumont's attention was directed to him and to Mr. Palmer.
      She introduced them to each other, with many expressions of regret that
      they should not sooner have met.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters that are free from artifice immediately coalesce, as metals
      that are perfectly pure can be readily cemented together. Mr. Palmer and
      Mr. Walsingham were intimate in half an hour. There was an air of openness
      and sincerity about Mr. Walsingham; a freedom and directness in his
      conversation, which delighted Mr. Palmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am heartily glad we have met at last, my good cousin Walsingham," said
      he: "very sorry should I have been to have left the country without
      becoming acquainted with you: and now I wish your gallant captain was
      arrived. I am to set off the day after to-morrow, and I am sadly afraid I
      shall miss seeing him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Walsingham said, that as they expected him every hour, he hoped Mr.
      Palmer would persuade Mrs. Beaumont to spend the day at Walsingham House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont dared not object. On the contrary, it was now her policy to
      pretend the fondest friendship for all the Walsingham family: yet, all the
      time, pursuing her plan of preventing Mr. Palmer from discerning their
      real characters and superior merit, she managed with great dexterity to
      keep the conversation as much as possible upon general topics, and tried
      to prevent Mr. Palmer from being much alone with Mr. Walsingham, for she
      dreaded their growing intimacy. After dinner, however, when the ladies
      retired, the gentlemen drew their chairs close together, and had a great
      deal of conversation on interesting subjects. The most interesting was
      Captain Walsingham: Mr. Palmer earnestly desired to hear the particulars
      of his history.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And from whom," said young Beaumont, turning to Mr. Walsingham, "can he
      hear them better than from Captain Walsingham's guardian and friend?"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Yet never seaman more serenely brave Led Britain's conquering squadrons
      o'er the wave."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friends are not always the best biographers," said Mr. Walsingham; "but I
      will try to be impartial. My ward's first desire to be a sailor was
      excited, as he has often since told me, by reading Robinson Crusoe. When
      he was scarcely thirteen he went out in the Resolute, a frigate, under the
      command of Captain Campbell. Campbell was an excellent officer, and very
      strict in all that related to order and discipline. It was his principle
      and his practice never to forgive <i>a first offence</i>; by which the
      number of second faults was considerably diminished. My ward was not much
      pleased at first with his captain; but he was afterwards convinced that
      this strictness was what made a man of him. He was buffeted about, and
      shown the rough of life; made to work hard, and submit to authority. To
      reason he was always ready to yield; and by degrees he learned that his
      first duty as a sailor was implicit obedience. In due time he was made
      lieutenant: in this situation, his mixed duties of command and obedience
      were difficult, because his first-lieutenant, the captain's son, was
      jealous of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Walsingham found it a more difficult task to win the confidence of the
      son than it had been to earn the friendship of the father. His punctuality
      in obeying orders, and his respectful manner to the lieutenant, availed
      but little; for young Campbell still viewed him with scornful yet with
      jealous eyes, imagining that he only wanted to show himself the better
      officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of the falsehood of these suspicions Walsingham had at last an
      opportunity of giving unquestionable proof. It happened one day that
      Lieutenant Campbell, impatient at seeing a sailor doing some work
      awkwardly on the outside of the vessel, snatched the rope from his hand,
      and swore he would do it himself. In his hurry, Campbell missed his
      footing, and fell overboard:&mdash;he could not swim. Walsingham had the
      presence of mind to order the ship to be put about, and plunged instantly
      into the water to save his rival. With much exertion he reached Campbell,
      supported him till the boat was lowered down, and got him safe aboard
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just like himself!" cried young Beaumont; "all he ever wanted was
      opportunity to show his soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The first-lieutenant's jealousy was now changed into gratitude,"
      continued Mr. Walsingham; "and from this time forward, instead of
      suffering from that petty rivalship by which he used to be obstructed,
      Walsingham enjoyed the entire confidence of young Campbell. This good
      understanding between him and his brother officer not only made their
      every day lives pleasant, but in times of difficulty secured success. For
      three years that they lived together after this period, and during which
      time they were ordered to every quarter of the globe, they never had the
      slightest dispute, either in the busiest or the idlest times. At length,
      in some engagement with a Dutch ship, the particulars of which I forget,
      Lieutenant Campbell was mortally wounded: his last words were&mdash;'Walsingham,
      comfort my father.' That was no easy task. Stern as Captain Campbell
      seemed, the loss of his son was irreparable. He never shed a tear when he
      was told it was all over, but said, 'God's will be done;' and turning into
      his cabin, desired to be left alone. Half an hour afterwards he sent for
      Walsingham, who found him quite calm. 'We must see and do our duty
      together to the last,' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He exerted himself strenuously, and to all outward appearance was, as the
      sailors said, the same man as ever; but Walsingham, who knew him better,
      saw that his heart was broken, and that he wished for nothing but an
      honourable death. One morning as he was on deck looking through his glass,
      he called to Walsingham; 'Your eyes are better than mine,' said he; 'look
      here, and tell me, do you see yonder sail&mdash;she's French? Le Magnanime
      frigate, if I'm not mistaken. 'Yes,' said Walsingham, 'I know her by the
      patch in her main sail.'&mdash;'We'll give her something to do,' said
      Campbell, 'though she's so much our superior. Please God, before the sun's
      over our heads, you shall have her in tow, Walsingham.' '<i>We</i> shall,
      I trust,' said Walsingham.&mdash;'Perhaps not <i>we</i>; for I own I wish
      to fall,' said Campbell. 'You are first-lieutenant now; I can't leave my
      men under better command, and I hope the Admiralty will give you the ship,
      if you give it to his Majesty.'&mdash;Then turning to the sailors, Captain
      Campbell addressed them with a countenance unusually cheerful; and, after
      a few words of encouragement, gave orders to clear decks for action.
      'Walsingham, you'll see to every thing whilst I step down to write.' He
      wrote, as it was afterwards found, two letters, both concerning
      Walsingham's interests. The frigate with which they had to engage was
      indeed far superior to them in force; but Campbell trusted to the good
      order and steadiness as well as to the courage of his men. The action was
      long and obstinate. Twice the English attempted to board the enemy, and
      twice were repulsed. The third time, just as Captain Campbell had seized
      hold of the French colours, which hung in rags over the side of the
      enemy's ship, he received a wound in his breast, fell back into
      Walsingham's arms, and almost instantly expired. The event of this day was
      different from what Campbell had expected, for <i>Le Succès</i> of fifty
      guns appeared in sight; and, after a desperate engagement with her, in
      which Walsingham was severely wounded, and every other officer on board
      killed or wounded, Walsingham saw that nothing was left but to make a
      wanton sacrifice of the remainder of his crew, or to strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After a contest of six hours, he struck to <i>Le Succès</i>. Perfect
      silence on his deck; a loud and insulting shout from the enemy!
    </p>
    <p>
      "No sooner had Walsingham struck, than La Force, the captain of <i>Le
      Succès</i> hailed him, and ordered him to come in his own boat, and to
      deliver his sword. Walsingham replied, that 'his sword, so demanded,
      should never be delivered but with his life.'<a href="#linknote-2"
      name="linknoteref-2" id="linknoteref-2"><small>2</small></a> The Frenchman
      did not think proper to persist; but soon after sent his lieutenant on
      board the Resolute, where the men were found at their quarters with
      lighted matches in their hands, ready to be as good as their word. La
      Force, the captain of <i>Le Succès</i>, was a sailor of fortune, who had
      risen by chance, not merit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, ay," interrupted Mr. Palmer, "so I thought; and there was no great
      merit, or glory either, in a French fifty gun taking an English frigate,
      after standing a six hours' contest with another ship. Well, my dear sir,
      what became of poor Walsingham? How did this rascally Frenchman treat his
      prisoners?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scandalously!" cried Beaumont; "and yet Walsingham is so generous that he
      will never let me damn the nation, for what he says was only the fault of
      an individual, who disgraced it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, let me hear and judge for myself," said Mr. Palmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "La Force carried the Resolute in triumph into a French port," continued
      Mr. Walsingham. "Vain of displaying his prisoners, he marched them up the
      country, under pretence that they would not be safe in a sea-port. Cambray
      was the town in which they were confined. Walsingham found the officers of
      the garrison very civil to him at first; but when they saw that he was not
      fond of high play, and that he declined being of their parties at
      billiards and <i>vingt-un</i>, they grew tired of him; for without these
      resources they declared they should perish with <i>ennui</i> in a country
      town. Even under the penalty of losing all society, Walsingham resisted
      every temptation to game, and submitted to live with the strictest economy
      rather than to run in debt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But did you never send him any money? Or did not he get your
      remittances?" said Mr. Palmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sir, by some delays of letters, we did not hear for two months
      where he was imprisoned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he was reduced to the greatest distress," pursued Beaumont; "for he
      had shared all he had, to the utmost farthing, with his poor
      fellow-prisoners."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like a true British sailor!" said Mr. Palmer. "Well, sir, I hope he
      contrived to make his escape?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, for he would not break his parole," said Beaumont,
    </p>
    <p>
      "His parole! I did not know he was on his parole," said Mr. Palmer. "Then
      certainly he could not break it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He had two tempting opportunities, I can assure you," said Beaumont; "one
      offered by the commandant's lady, who was not insensible to his merit; the
      other, by the gratitude of some poor servant, whom he had obliged&mdash;Mr.
      Walsingham can tell you all the particulars."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I need not detail the circumstances; it is enough to tell you, sir,
      that he withstood the temptations, would not break his parole, and
      remained four months a prisoner in Cambray. Like the officers of the
      garrison, he should have drunk or gamed, or else he must have died of
      vexation, he says, if he had not fortunately had a taste for reading, and
      luckily procured books from a good old priest's library. At the end of
      four months the garrison of Cambray was changed; and instead of a set of
      dissipated officers, there came a well-conducted regiment, under the
      command of M. de Villars, an elderly officer of sense and discretion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An excellent man!" cried Beaumont: "I love him with all my soul, though I
      never saw him. But I beg your pardon for interrupting you, Mr.
      Walsingham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A prattling hairdresser at Cambray first prepossessed M. de Villars in
      Walsingham's favour, by relating a number of anecdotes intended to throw
      abuse and ridicule upon the English captain, to convict him of misanthropy
      and economy; of having had his hair dressed but twice since he came to
      Cambray; of never having frequented the society of Madame la Marquise de
      Marsillac, the late commandant's lady, for more than a fortnight after his
      arrival, and of having actually been detected in working with his own hand
      with smiths' and carpenters' tools. Upon the strength of the hairdresser's
      information, M. de Villars paid the English captain a visit; was pleased
      by his conversation, and by all that he observed of his conduct and
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As M. de Villars was going down stairs, after having spent an evening
      with Walsingham, a boy of twelve years old, the son of the master of the
      lodging-house, equipped in a military uniform, stood across the
      landing-place, as if determined to, stop him. 'Mon petit militaire,' said
      the commandant, 'do you mean to dispute my passage?' 'Non, mon général,'
      said the boy; 'I know my duty too well. But I post myself here to demand
      an audience, for I have a secret of importance to communicate.' M. de
      Villars, smiling at the boy's air of consequence, yet pleased with the
      steady earnestness of his manner, took him by the hand into an
      antechamber, and said that he was ready to listen to whatever he had to
      impart. The boy then told him that he had accidentally overheard a
      proposal which had been made to facilitate the English captain's escape,
      and that the captain refused to comply with it, because it was not
      honourable to break his parole. The boy, who had been struck by the
      circumstance, and who, besides, was grateful to Walsingham for some little
      instances of kindness, spoke with much enthusiasm in his favour; and, as
      M. de Villars afterwards repeated, finished his speech by exclaiming, 'I
      would give every thing I have in the world, except my sword and my honour,
      to procure this English captain his liberty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. de Villars was pleased with the boy's manner, and with the fact which
      he related; so much so, that he promised, that if Walsingham's liberty
      could be obtained he would procure it. 'And you, my good little friend,
      shall, if I succeed,' added he, 'have the pleasure of being the first to
      tell him the good news.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some days afterwards, the boy burst into Walsingham's room, exclaiming,
      'Liberty! liberty! you are at liberty!'&mdash;He danced and capered with
      such wild joy, that it was some time before Walsingham could obtain any
      explanation, or could prevail on him to let him look at a letter which he
      held in his hand, flourishing it about in triumph. At last he showed that
      it was an order from M. de Villars, for the release of Captain Walsingham,
      and of all the English prisoners, belonging to the Resolute, for whom
      exchanges had been effected. No favour could be granted in a manner more
      honourable to all the parties concerned. Walsingham arrived in England
      without any farther difficulties."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God!" said Mr. Palmer. "Well, now he has touched English ground
      again, I have some hopes for him. What next?"
    </p>

      "The first thing he did, of course, was to announce his return to the
      Admiralty. A court-martial was held at Portsmouth; and, fortunately for
      him, was composed of officers of the highest distinction, so that the
      first men in his profession became thoroughly acquainted with the
      circumstances of his conduct. The enthusiasm with which his men bore
      testimony in his favour was gratifying to his feelings, and the minutes of
      the evidence were most honourable to him. The court pronounced, that
      Lieutenant Walsingham had done all that could be effected by the most
      gallant and judicious officer in the defence of His Majesty's ship
      Resolute. The ministry who had employed Captain Campbell were no longer in
      place, and one of the Lords of the Admiralty at this time happened to have
      had some personal quarrel with him. A few days after the trial, Walsingham
      was at a public dinner, at which Campbell's character became the subject
      of conversation. Walsingham was warned, in a whisper, that the first Lord
      of the Admiralty's private secretary was present, and was advised to be <i>prudent</i>;
      but Walsingham's prudence was not of that sort which can coolly hear a
      worthy man's memory damned with faint praise; his prudence was not of that
      sort which can tamely sit by and see a friend's reputation in danger. With
      all the warmth and eloquence of friendship, he spoke in Captain Campbell's
      defence, and paid a just and energetic tribute of praise to his memory. He
      spoke, and not a word more was said against Campbell. The politicians
      looked down upon their plates; and there was a pause of that sort, which
      sometimes in a company of interested men of the world results from
      surprise at the imprudent honesty of a good-natured novice. Walsingham, as
      the company soon afterwards broke up, heard one gentleman say of him to
      another, as they went away, 'There's a fellow now, who has ruined himself
      without knowing it, and all for a dead man.' It was not without knowing
      it: Walsingham was well aware what he hazarded, but he was then, and ever,
      ready to sacrifice his own interests in the defence of truth and of a
      friend. For two long years afterwards, Walsingham was, in the technical
      and elegant phrase, <i>left on the shelf, and the door of promotion was
      shut against him."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and there he might have remained till now," said Beaumont, "if it
      had not been for that good Mr. Gaspar, a clerk in one of their offices; a
      man who, though used to live among courtiers and people hackneyed in the
      political ways of the world, was a plain, warm-hearted friend, a man of an
      upright character, who prized integrity and generosity the more because he
      met with them so seldom. But I beg your pardon, Mr. Walsingham; will you
      go on and tell Mr. Palmer how and why Gaspar served our friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One day Walsingham had occasion to go to Mr. Gaspar's office to search
      for some papers relative to certain charts which he had drawn, and
      intended to present to the Admiralty. In talking of the soundings of some
      bay he had taken whilst out with Captain Campbell, he mentioned him, as he
      always did, with terms of affection and respect. Mr. Gaspar immediately
      asked, 'Are you, sir, that Lieutenant Walsingham, of the Resolute, who at
      a public dinner about two years ago made such a disinterested defence of
      your captain? If it is in my power to serve you, depend upon it I will.
      Leave your charts with me; I think I may have an opportunity of turning
      them to your advantage, and that of the service.' Gaspar, who was
      thoroughly in earnest, took a happy moment to present Walsingham's charts
      before the Admiralty, just at a time when they were wanted. The Admiralty
      were glad to employ an officer who had some local information, and they
      sent him out in the Dreadnought, a thirty-six gun frigate, with Captain
      Jemmison, to the West Indies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what sort of a man was his new captain?" said Mr. Palmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As unlike his old one as possible," said Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," continued Mr. Walsingham; "in every point, except courage, Captain
      Jemmison was as complete a contrast as could be imagined to Captain
      Campbell. Whatever else he might be, Jemmison was certainly a man of
      undaunted courage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's of course, if he was a captain in the British navy," said Mr.
      Palmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From his appearance, however, you would never have taken him for a
      gallant sailor," said Mr. Walsingham: "abhorring the rough, brutal,
      swearing, grog-drinking, tobacco-chewing, race of sea-officers, the Bens
      and the Mirvans of former times, Captain Jemmison, resolving, I suppose,
      to avoid their faults, went into the contrary extreme of refinement and
      effeminacy. A superlative coxcomb, and an epicure more from fashion than
      taste, he gloried in descanting, with technical precision, on the merits
      of dishes and of cooks. His table, even on shipboard, was to be equalled
      in elegance only by his toilet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The puppy!" exclaimed Mr. Palmer. "And how could Captain Walsingham go on
      with such a coxcomb?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very ill, you may be sure," said Beaumont; "for Walsingham, I'll answer
      for it, never could conceal or control his feelings of contempt or
      indignation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet, as Captain Jemmison's lieutenant, he always behaved with perfect
      propriety," said Mr. Walsingham, "and bore with his foppery and
      impertinence with the patience becoming a subordinate officer to his
      superior. Jemmison could not endure a lieutenant whose character and
      manners were a continual contrast and reproach to his own, and he disliked
      him the more because he could never provoke him to any disrespect.
      Jemmison often replied even to Walsingham's silent contempt; as a French
      pamphleteer once published a book entitled, <i>Réponse au Silence de M. de
      la Motte</i>. On some points, where duty and principle were concerned,
      Walsingham, however, could not be silent. There was a lad of the name of
      Birch on board the Dreadnought, whom Walsingham had taken under his
      immediate care, and whom he was endeavouring to train up in every good
      habit. Jemmison, to torment Walsingham, made it his pleasure to counteract
      him in these endeavours, and continually did all he could to spoil Birch
      by foolish indulgence. Walsingham's indignation was upon these occasions
      vehement, and his captain and he came to frequent quarrels. Young Birch,
      who had sense enough to know which was his true friend, one day threw
      himself on his knees to beseech his lieutenant not to hazard so much on
      his account, and solemnly swore that he would never be guilty of the
      slightest excess or negligence during the remainder of the voyage. The
      young man was steady to his promise, and by his resolution and temper
      prevented Walsingham and his captain from coming to a serious rupture.
      When they arrived at their place of destination, Jamaica, Captain Jemmison
      went on shore to divert himself, and spent his time in great dissipation
      at Spanish Town, eating, dressing, dancing, gallanting, and glorying in
      its being observed by all the ladies that he had nothing of a sea-captain
      about him. The other officers, encouraged by his precept and example, left
      the ship; but Walsingham stayed on board, and had severe duty to perform,
      for he could not allow the crew to go on shore, because they got into
      riots with the townspeople. Soon after their arrival, and even during the
      course of their voyage, he had observed among the sailors something like a
      disposition to mutiny, encouraged probably by the negligence and apparent
      effeminacy of their captain. Though they knew him to be a man of
      intrepidity, yet they ridiculed and despised his coxcombry, and his
      relaxation of discipline gave them hopes of succeeding in their mutinous
      schemes. Walsingham strongly and repeatedly represented to Captain
      Jemmison the danger, and remonstrated with him and the other officers upon
      the imprudence of leaving the ship at this juncture; but Jemmison, in a
      prettily rounded period, protested he saw no penumbra of danger, and that
      till he was called upon by Mars, he owned he preferred the charms of
      Venus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This was vastly elegant; but, nevertheless, it happened one night, when
      the captain, after having eaten an admirable supper, was paying his court
      to a Creole lady of Spanish Town, news was brought him, that the crew of
      the Dreadnought had mutinied, and that Lieutenant Walsingham was killed.
      One half of the report was true, and the other nearly so. At midnight,
      after having been exhausted during the preceding week by his vigilance,
      Walsingham had just thrown himself into his cot, when he was roused by
      Birch at his cabin-door, crying, 'A mutiny! a mutiny on deck!'&mdash;Walsingham
      seized his drawn cutlass, and ran up the ladder, determined to cut down
      the ringleader; but just as he reached the top, the sailors shut down the
      hatchway, which struck his head with such violence, that he fell, stunned,
      and, to all appearance, dead. Birch contrived, in the midst of the bustle,
      before he was himself seized by the mutineers, to convey, by signals to
      shore, news of what had happened. But Captain Jemmison could now be of no
      use. Before he could take any measures to prevent them, the mutineers
      weighed anchor, and the Dreadnought, under a brisk breeze, was out of the
      bay; all the other vessels in the harbour taking it for granted that her
      captain was on board, and that she was sailing under orders. In the mean
      time, whilst Walsingham was senseless, the sailors stowed him into his
      cabin, and set a guard over him. The ringleader, Jefferies, a revengeful
      villain, who bore malice against him for some just punishment, wanted to
      murder him, but the rest would not consent. Some would not dip their hands
      in blood; others pleaded for him, and said that he was never cruel. One
      man urged, that the lieutenant had been kind to him when he was sick.
      Another suggested, that it would be well to keep him alive to manage the
      ship for them, in case of difficulties. Conscious of their ignorance, they
      acceded to this advice; Jefferies' proposal to murder him was overruled:
      and it was agreed to keep Walsingham close prisoner till they should need
      his assistance. He had his timekeeper and log-book locked up with him,
      which were totally forgotten by these miscreants. Never seaman prayed more
      fervently for fair weather than Walsingham now did for a storm. At last,
      one night he heard (and he says it was one of the pleasantest sounds he
      ever heard in his life) the wind rising. Soon it blew a storm. He heard
      one of the sailors say&mdash;'A stiff gale, Jack!' and another&mdash;'An
      ugly night!' Presently, great noise on deck, and the pumps at work. Every
      moment he now expected a deputation from the mutineers. The first person
      he saw was the carpenter, who came in to knock in the dead lights in the
      cabin windows. The man was surly, and would give no answer to any
      questions; but Walsingham knew, by the hurry of his work, that the fellow
      thought there was no time to be lost. Twice, before he could finish what
      he was about, messages came from <i>Captain Jefferies,</i> to order him to
      something else. Then a violent crash above from the fall of a mast; and
      then he heard one cry&mdash;'I'll be cursed if I should care, if we did
      but know where-abouts we are.' Then all was in such uproar, that no voices
      could be distinguished. At last his cabin-door unlocked, and many voices
      called upon him at once to come upon deck that instant and save the ship.
      Walsingham absolutely refused to do any thing for them till they returned
      to their duty, delivered up to him their arms, and their ringleader,
      Jefferies. At this answer they stood aghast. Some tried entreaties, some
      threats: all in vain. Walsingham coolly said, he would go to the bottom
      along with the ship rather than say a word to save them, till they
      submitted. The storm blew stronger&mdash;the danger every moment
      increasing. One of the mutineers came with a drawn cutlass, another
      levelled a blunderbuss at Walsingham, swearing to despatch him that
      instant, if he would not tell them where they were. 'Murder me, and you
      will be hanged; persist in your mutiny, you'll be drowned,' said
      Walsingham. 'You'll never make me swerve from my duty&mdash;and you know
      it&mdash;you have my answer.' The enraged sailors seized him in their
      arms, and carried him by force upon deck, where the sight of the danger,
      and the cries of 'Throw him overboard!&mdash;over with him!' only seemed
      to fortify his resolution. Not a word, not a sign could they get from him.
      The rudder was now unshipped! At this the sailors' fury turned suddenly
      upon Jefferies, who between terror and ignorance was utterly
      incapacitated. They seized, bound, gave him up to Walsingham, returned to
      their duty; and then, and not till then, Walsingham resumed his command.
      Walsingham's voice, once more heard, inspired confidence, and with the
      hopes revived the exertions of the sailors. I am not seaman enough to tell
      you how the ship was saved; but that it was saved, and saved by
      Walsingham, is certain. I remember only, that he made the ship manageable
      by some contrivance, which he substituted in the place of the rudder that
      had been unshipped. The storm abating, he made for the first port, to
      repair the ship's damages, intending to return to Jamaica, to deliver her
      up to her captain; but, from a vessel they spoke at sea, he learned that
      Jemmison was gone to England in a merchantman. To England then Walsingham
      prepared to follow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And with this rebel crew!" cried Beaumont; "think, Mr. Palmer, what a
      situation he was in, knowing, as he did, that every rascal of them would
      sooner go to the devil than go home, where they knew they must be tried
      for their mutiny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir, well!" said Mr. Palmer. "Did they run away with the ship a
      second time? or how did he manage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He called them all one morning together on deck; and pointing to the place
      where the gunpowder was kept, he said&mdash;'I have means of blowing up
      the ship. If ever you attempt to mutiny again, the first finger you lay
      upon me, I blow her up instantly.' They had found him to be a man of
      resolution. They kept to their duty. Not a symptom of disobedience during
      the rest of the voyage. In their passage they fell in with an enemy's
      ship, far superior to them in force. 'There, my lads!' said Walsingham,
      'if you have a mind to earn your pardons, there's your best chance. Take
      her home with you to your captain and your king.' A loud cheer was their
      answer. They fought like devils to redeem themselves. Walsingham&mdash;but
      without stopping to make his panegyric, I need only tell you, that
      Walsingham's conduct and intrepidity were this time crowned with success.
      He took the enemy's ship, and carried it in triumph into Portsmouth.
      Jemmison was on the platform when they came in; and what a mortifying
      sight it was to him, and what a proud hour to Walsingham, you may imagine!
      Having delivered the Dreadnought and her prize over to his captain, the
      next thing to be thought of was the trial of the mutineers. All except
      Jefferies obtained a pardon, in consideration of their return to duty, and
      their subsequent services. Jefferies was hanged at the yard-arm. The trial
      of the mutineers brought on, as Jemmison foresaw it must, many
      animadversions on his own conduct. Powerful connexions, and his friends in
      place, silenced, as much as possible, the public voice. Jemmison gave
      excellent dinners, and endeavoured to drown the whole affair in his choice
      Champagne and <i>London particular Madeira</i>; so his health, and success
      to the British navy, was drunk in bumper toasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, ay, they think to do every thing now in England by dinners, and
      bumper toasts, and three times three," said Mr. Palmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it did not do in this instance," said Beaumont, in a tone of
      exultation: "it did not do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," continued Mr. Walsingham; "though Jemmison's dinners went down
      vastly well with a party, they did not satisfy the public. The opposition
      papers grew clamorous, and the business was taken up so strongly, and it
      raised such a cry against the ministry, that they were obliged to bring
      Jemmison to a court-martial."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The puppy! I'm glad of it, with all my soul. And how did he look then?"
      said Mr. Palmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vastly like a gentleman; that was all that even his friends could say for
      him. The person he was most afraid of on the trial was Walsingham. In this
      apprehension he was confirmed by certain of his friends, who had attempted
      to sound Walsingham as to the nature of the evidence he intended to give.
      They all reported, that they could draw nothing out of him, and that he
      was an impracticable fellow; for his constant answer was, that his
      evidence should be given in court, and nowhere else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even to his most intimate friends," interrupted Mr. Beaumont, "even to
      me, who was in the house with him all the time the trial was going on, he
      did not tell what his evidence would be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the day of trial came," pursued Mr. Walsingham&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't forget Admiral Dashleigh," said Mr. Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; who can forget him that knows him?" said Walsingham: "a warm,
      generous friend, open-hearted as he is brave&mdash;he came to Captain
      Walsingham the day before the court-martial was to sit. 'I know,
      Walsingham, you don't like my cousin Jemmison (said he), nor do I much,
      for he is a puppy, and I never could like a puppy, related to me or not;
      be that as it may, you'll do him justice, I'm sure; for though he is a
      puppy he is a brave fellow&mdash;and here, for party purposes, they have
      raised a cry of his being a coward, and want to shoot him <i>pour
      encourager les autres</i>. What you say will damn or save him; and I have
      too good an opinion of you to think that any old grudge, though you might
      have cause for it, would stand in his way.' Walsingham answered as usual,
      that his opinion and his evidence would be known on the day of trial.
      Dashleigh went away very ill-satisfied, and persuaded that Walsingham
      harboured revenge against his relation. At last, when he was called upon
      in court, Walsingham's conduct was both just and generous; for though his
      answers spoke the exact truth, yet he brought forward nothing to the
      disadvantage of Jemmison, but what truth compelled him to state, and in
      his captain's favour; on the contrary, he spoke so strongly of his
      intrepidity, and of the gallant actions which in former instances he had
      performed in the service, as quite to efface the recollection of his
      foppery and epicurism, and, as much as possible, to excuse his negligence.
      Walsingham's evidence absolutely confuted the unjust charge or suspicion
      of cowardice that had been raised against Jemmison; and made such an
      impression in his favour, that, instead of being dismissed the service, or
      even having his ship taken from him, as was expected, Jemmison got off
      with a reprimand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which I am sure he well deserved," said Mr. Palmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But certainly Walsingham was right not to let him be run down by a
      popular cry, especially as he had used him ill," said Mr. Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well!&mdash;I don't care about the puppy," cried Mr. Palmer; "only
      go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No sooner was the trial over, and the sentence of the court made known,
      than Admiral Dashleigh, full of joy, admiration, and gratitude, pushed his
      way towards Walsingham, and stretching out his hand, exclaimed&mdash;'Shake
      hands, Walsingham, and forgive me, or I can't forgive myself. I suspected
      you yesterday morning of bearing malice against that coxcomb, who deserved
      to be laughed at, but not to be shot. By Jove, Walsingham, you're an
      honest fellow, I find.' 'And have you but just found that out, admiral?'
      said Walsingham, with a proud smile. 'Harkee, my lad,' said Dashleigh,
      calling after him, 'remember, I'm <i>your</i> friend, at all events.&mdash;Take
      it as you will, I'll make you mine yet, before I've done with you.'
      Walsingham knew that at this time Admiral Dashleigh's friends were in
      power, and that Dashleigh himself had great influence with the Admiralty;
      and he probably treated the admiral thus haughtily, to show that he had no
      interested views or hopes. Dashleigh understood this, for he now
      comprehended Walsingham's character perfectly. Immediately after the
      trial, Walsingham was made commander, in consequence of his having saved
      the Dreadnought, and his having taken l'Ambuscade. With this appointment
      Dashleigh had nothing to do. But he never ceased exerting himself,
      employing all the interest of his high connexions, and all the personal
      influence of his great abilities, to have Walsingham made post, and to get
      him a ship. He succeeded at last; but he never gave the least hint that it
      was done by his interest; for, he said, he knew that Walsingham had such
      nice notions, and was such a proud principled fellow, that he would not
      enjoy his promotion, if he thought he owed it to any thing upon earth but
      his own merit. So a handsome letter was written by the secretary of the
      Admiralty to Captain Walsingham, by their lordships' desire, informing
      him, 'that in consideration of his services and merit, his majesty had
      been pleased to make him post-captain, and to appoint him to the command
      of l'Ambuscade (the prize he took), which would be sent out on the first
      occasion.' The secretary 'begged leave to add expressions of his private
      satisfaction on an appointment so likely to be advantageous to the
      public,' &amp;c. In short, it was all done so properly and so plausibly,
      that even Walsingham never suspected any secret influence, nor did he find
      out the part Dashleigh had taken in the business till several months
      afterwards, when a <i>discreet</i> friend mentioned it by accident."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was that discreet friend," said Mr. Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, all this is very good, but there's no love in this Story," said Mr.
      Palmer. "I hope your hero is not too proud to fall in love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too proud!&mdash;We are told, you know, that the greatest hero, in the
      intervals of war, resigned
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'To tender passions all his mighty mind.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      "Tender passions!&mdash;Captain Walsingham is in love, then, hey?" said
      Mr. Palmer. "And may I ask&mdash;Bless me! I shall be very sorry if it is
      with any body but&mdash;may I ask to whom he is attached?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a question that I am not quite at liberty perhaps to answer,"
      said Mr. Walsingham. "During the interval between his return in the
      Dreadnought and his being appointed to l'Ambuscade, an interval of about
      eighteen months, which he spent in the country here with me, he had time
      to become thoroughly acquainted with a very amiable young lady&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very amiable young lady! and in this neighbourhood?" interrupted Mr.
      Palmer; "it must be the very person I mean, the very person I wish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not ask me any more," said Mr. Walsingham; "for my friend never
      declared his attachment, and I have no right to declare it for him. He was
      not, at the time I speak of, in circumstances to marry; therefore he
      honourably concealed, or rather suppressed, his passion, resolving not to
      attempt to engage the young lady's affections till he should have made a
      fortune sufficient to support her in her own rank in life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, now, that's all done, thank Heaven!" cried Palmer: "he has fortune
      enough now, or we can help him out, you know. This is excellent,
      excellent!&mdash;Come, is it not time for us to go to the ladies? I'm
      impatient to tell this to Mrs. Beaumont."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay, my good Mr. Palmer," said Mr. Walsingham. "What are you going to
      do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me alone, let me alone&mdash;I'll only tell what I guess&mdash;depend
      upon it, I guess right&mdash;and it may do a great deal of good to tell it
      to Mrs. Beaumont, and it will give her a great deal of pleasure&mdash;trust
      me&mdash;trust me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do trust <i>you</i>&mdash;but perhaps you may be mistaken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, not at all, depend upon it; so let me go to her this minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But stop, my dear sir," cried Mr. Beaumont, "stop for another reason; let
      me beg you to sit down again&mdash;I am not clear that Captain Walsingham
      is not at this instant in love with&mdash;perhaps, as it is reported,
      married to a Spanish lady, whom he has carried off out of a convent at
      &mdash;&mdash;, and whom I understand he is bringing home with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heyday! a Spanish lady!" said Mr. Palmer, returning slowly to his seat
      with a fallen countenance. "How's this?&mdash;By St. George, this is
      unlucky! But how's this, I say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did not let us finish our story," said Mr. Beaumont, "or we should
      have told you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me hear the end of it now," said Mr. Palmer, sitting down again, and
      preparing himself with several pinches of snuff. But just at this instant
      a servant came to say that coffee was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will never stir from this spot for coffee or any thing else," said Mr.
      Palmer, "till I know the history of the Spanish lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then the shortest and best way I have of telling it to you is, to beg you
      to read this letter, which contains all I know of the matter," said Mr.
      Beaumont. "This letter is from young Birch to his parents; we have never
      heard a syllable directly from Walsingham himself on this subject. Since
      he reached Lisbon, we have had no letters from him, except that short
      epistle which brought us an account of his taking the treasure-ship. But
      we shall see him soon, and know the truth of this story; and hear whether
      he prefers his Spanish or his English mistress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Fore George! I wish this Spanish woman had stayed in her convent," said
      Mr. Palmer; "I don't like runaway ladies. But let us see what this letter
      says for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter is the same that Mr. Beaumont read some time ago, therefore it
      need not here be inserted. Before Mr. Palmer had finished perusing it, a
      second message came to say that the ladies waited tea, and that Mrs.
      Beaumont wished not to be late going home, as there was no moon. Mr.
      Palmer, nevertheless, finished the letter before he stirred: and then,
      with a heavy sigh, he rose and said, "I now wish, more than ever, that our
      captain would come home this night, before I go, and clear up this
      business. I don't like this Spanish plot, this double intrigue. Ah, dear
      me!&mdash;I shall be obliged to sail&mdash;I shall be in Jamaica before
      the fifth act."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How expectation loads the wings of time!" exclaimed Mrs. Beaumont, as the
      gentlemen entered the drawing-room. "Here we have been all day expecting
      our dear Captain Walsingham, and the time has seemed so long!&mdash;The
      only time I ever found long in this house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to know," said Mr. Walsingham, after a bow of due
      acknowledgment to Mrs. Beaumont for her compliment, "I should like to know
      whether time appears to pass more slowly to those that hope, or those that
      fear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont handed coffee to Mr. Palmer, without attempting to answer
      this question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To those that hope, I should think," said Mr. Palmer; "for hope long
      deferred maketh the heart sick; and time, I can answer for it, passes most
      slowly to those who are sick."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "'Slow as the year's dull circle seems to run,
     When the brisk minor pants for twenty-one,'"
</pre>
    <p>
      said Mr. Walsingham, smiling, as he looked at young Beaumont. "But I think
      it is the mixture of fear with hope that makes time appear to pass
      slowly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is hope ever free from that mixture?" said Miss Walsingham. "Does not
      hope without fear become certainty, and fear without hope despair? Can
      hope ever be perfectly free from some mixture of fear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear me! yes, to be sure," said Miss Hunter; "for hope's the most
      opposite thing that ever was to fear; as different as black and white; <i>for</i>,
      surely, every body knows that hope is just the contrary to fear; and when
      one says, <i>I hope</i>, one does not ever mean <i>I fear</i>&mdash;surely,
      you know, Mrs. Beaumont?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am the worst metaphysician in the world," said Mrs. Beaumont; "I have
      not head enough to analyze my heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I neither," said Miss Hunter: "Heigho!" (very audibly.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hark!" cried Mr. Beaumont, "I think I hear a horse galloping. It is he!
      it is Walsingham!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Out ran Beaumont, full speed, to meet his friend; whilst, with, more sober
      joy, Mr. Walsingham waited on the steps, where all the company assembled,
      Mr. Palmer foremost, with a face full of benevolent pleasure; Mrs.
      Beaumont congratulating every body, but nobody listening to her; luckily
      for her, all were too heartily occupied with their own feelings to see how
      ill her countenance suited her words. The sound of the galloping of the
      horse ceased for a minute&mdash;then recommenced; but before it could be
      settled whether it was coming nearer or going farther away, Mr. Beaumont
      returned with a note in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not Walsingham&mdash;only Birch&mdash;confound him!" said Mr. Beaumont,
      out of breath. "Confound him, what a race I took, and how disappointed I
      was when I saw Birch's face; and yet it is no fault of his, poor lad!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why did not he come up to the house? Why did not you let us see him?"
      said Mr. Walsingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could not keep him, he was in such a hurry to go home to his father and
      mother, he would only stop to give this note."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From Walsingham? Read, quick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plymouth, 5 o'clock, A.M. just landed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear friends, I cannot have the pleasure of seeing you, as I had hoped to
      do, this day&mdash;I am obliged to go to London instantly on business that
      must not be delayed&mdash;Cannot tell when I can be with you&mdash;hope in
      a few days&mdash;Well and happy, and ever yours, H. WALSINGHAM."
    </p>
    <p>
      All stood silent with looks of disappointment, except Mrs. Beaumont, who
      reiterated, "What a pity! What a sad pity! What a disappointment! What a
      terrible disappointment!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Business!" said Mr. Beaumont: "curse his business! he should think of his
      friends first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most likely his business is for his friends," said Miss Walsingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right, my dear little defender of the absent," said Mr.
      Walsingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Business!" repeated Mr. Palmer. "Hum! I like business better than
      pleasure&mdash;I will be patient, if it is really business that keeps him
      away from us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Depend upon it," said Miss Walsingham, "nothing but business can keep him
      away from us; his pleasure is always at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am thinking," said Mr. Palmer, drawing Mr. Walsingham aside, "I am
      thinking whether he has really brought this Spanish lady home with him,
      and what will become of her&mdash;of&mdash;him, I mean. I wish I was not
      going to Jamaica!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, my dear sir, where is the necessity of your going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My health&mdash;my health&mdash;the physicians say I cannot live in
      England."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Walsingham, who had but little faith in physicians, laughed, and
      exclaimed, "But, my dear sir, when you see so many men alive in England at
      this instant, why should you believe in the impossibility of your living
      even in this pestiferous country?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Palmer half smiled, felt for his snuff-box, and then replied, "I am
      sure I should like to live in England, if my health would let me; but,"
      continued he, his face growing longer, and taking the hypochondriac cast
      as he pronounced the word, "<i>but, </i>Mr. Walsingham, you don't consider
      that my health is really&mdash;really&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really very good, I see," interrupted Mr. Walsingham, "and I am heartily
      glad to see it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir! sir! you do not see it, I assure you. I have a great opinion of your
      judgment, but as you are not a physician&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And because I have not taken out my diploma, you think I can neither see
      nor understand," interrupted Mr. Walsingham. "But, nevertheless, give me
      leave to feel your pulse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really understand a pulse?" said Mr. Palmer, baring his wrist, and
      sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As good a pulse as ever man had," pronounced Mr. Walsingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say so? why the physicians tell me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind what they tell you&mdash;if they told you the <i>truth</i>,
      they'd tell you they want fees."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont, quite startled by the tremendously loud voice in which Mr.
      Walsingham pronounced the word <i>truth</i>, rose, and rang the bell for
      her carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Palmer," said she, "I am afraid we must run away, for I dread the
      night air for invalids."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My good madam, I am at your orders," answered Mr. Palmer, buttoning
      himself up to the chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Beaumont, surely you don't think this gentleman an invalid?" said
      Mr. Walsingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only wish he would not think himself such," replied Mrs. Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! my dear friends," said Mr. Palmer, "I really am, I certainly am a sad&mdash;sad&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hypochondriac," said Mr. Walsingham. "Pardon me&mdash;you are indeed, and
      every body is afraid to tell you so but myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont anxiously looked out of the window to see if her carriage
      was come to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hypochondriac! not in the least, my dear sir," said Mr. Palmer. "If you
      were to hear what Dr. &mdash;&mdash; and Dr. &mdash;&mdash; say of my
      case, and your own Dr. Wheeler here, who has a great reputation too&mdash;shall
      I tell you what he says?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In a low voice, Mr. Palmer, holding Mr. Walsingham by the button,
      proceeded to recapitulate some of Dr. Wheeler's prognostics; and at every
      pause, Mr. Walsingham turned impatiently, so as almost to twist off the
      detaining button, repeating, in the words of the king of Prussia to his
      physician, "<i>C'est un âne! C'est un âne! C'est un âne!</i>"&mdash;"Pshaw!
      I don't understand French," cried Mr. Palmer, angrily. His warmth obliged
      him to think of unbuttoning his coat, which operation (after stretching
      his neckcloth to remove an uneasy feeling in his throat) he was
      commencing, when Mrs. Beaumont graciously stopped his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The carriage is at the door, my dear sir:&mdash;instead of unbuttoning
      your coat, had not you better put this cambric handkerchief round your
      throat before we go into the cold air?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Palmer put it on, as if in defiance of Mr. Walsingham, and followed
      Mrs. Beaumont, who led him off in triumph. Before he reached the
      carriage-door, however, his anger had spent its harmless force; and
      stopping to shake hands with him, Mr. Palmer said, "My good Mr.
      Walsingham, I am obliged to you. I am sure you wish me well, and I thank
      you for speaking so freely; I love honest friends&mdash;but as to my being
      a hypochondriac, believe me, you are mistaken!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And as to Dr. Wheeler," said Mrs. Beaumont, as she drew up the glass of
      the carriage, and as they drove from the door, "Dr. Wheeler certainly does
      not deserve to be called <i>un âne,</i> for he is a man of whose medical
      judgment I have the highest opinion. Though I am sure I am very candid to
      acknowledge it in the present case, when his opinion is so much against my
      wishes, and all our wishes, and must, I fear, deprive us so soon of the
      company of our dear Mr. Palmer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes, I must go, I must go to Jamaica," said Mr. Palmer in a more
      determined tone than he had yet spoken on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont silently rejoiced; and as her son imprudently went on
      arguing in favour of his own wishes, she leaned back in the carriage, and
      gave herself up to a pleasing reverie, in which she anticipated the
      successful completion of all her schemes. Relieved from the apprehension
      that Captain Walsingham's arrival might disconcert her projects, she was
      now still further re-assured by Mr. Palmer's resolution to sail
      immediately. One day more, and she was safe. Let Mr. Palmer but sail
      without seeing Captain Walsingham, and this was all Mrs. Beaumont asked of
      fortune; the rest her own genius would obtain. She was so absorbed in
      thought, that she did not know she was come home, till the carriage
      stopped at her door. Sometimes, indeed, her reverie had been interrupted
      by Mr. Palmer's praises of the Walsinghams, and by a conversation which
      she heard going on about Captain Walsingham's life and adventures: but
      Captain Walsingham was safe in London; and whilst he was at that distance,
      she could bear to hear his eulogium. Having lamented that she had been
      deprived of her dear Amelia all this day, and having arranged her plan of
      operations for the morrow, Mrs. Beaumont retired to rest. And even in
      dreams her genius invented fresh expedients, wrote notes of apology, or
      made speeches of circumvention.

      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "And now, as oft in some distempered state, On one nice trick depends the
      general fate."&mdash;POPE.
    </p>
    <p>
      That old politician, the cardinal of Lorraine, used to say, that "a lie
      believed but for one hour doth many times in a nation produce effects of
      seven years' continuance." At this rate what wonderful effects might our
      heroine have produced, had she practised in public life, instead of
      confining her genius to family politics! The game seemed now in her own
      hands. The day, the important day, on which all her accounts with her son
      were to be settled; the day when Mr. Palmer's will was to be signed, the
      last day he was to stay in England, arrived. Mr. Beaumont's birthday, his
      coming of age, was of course hailed with every possible demonstration of
      joy. The village bells rang, the tenants were invited to a dinner and a
      dance, and an ox was to be roasted whole; and the preparations for
      rejoicing were heard all over the house. Mr. Palmer's benevolent heart was
      ever ready to take a share in the pleasures of his fellow-creatures,
      especially in the festivities of the lower classes. He appeared this
      morning in high good humour. Mrs. Beaumont, with a smile on her lips, yet
      with a brow of care, was considering how she could make pleasure
      subservient to interest, and how she could get <i>business</i> done in the
      midst of the amusements of the day. Most auspiciously did her day of
      business begin by Mr. Palmer's declaring to her that his will was actually
      made; that with the exception of certain legacies, he had left his whole
      fortune to her during her life, with remainder to her son and daughter.
      "By this arrangement," continued he, "I trust I shall ultimately serve my
      good friends the Walsinghams, as I wish: for though I have not seen as
      much of that family as I should have been glad to have done, yet the
      little I have seen convinces me that they are worthy people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The most worthy people upon earth. You know I have the greatest regard
      for them," said Mrs. Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am really sorry," pursued Mr. Palmer, "that I have not been able to
      make acquaintance with Captain Walsingham. Mr. Walsingham told me his
      whole history yesterday, and it has prepossessed me much in his favour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is, indeed, a charming, noble-hearted young hero," said Mrs. Beaumont;
      "and I regret, as much as you do, that you cannot see him before you leave
      England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "However," continued Mr. Palmer, "as I was saying, the Walsinghams will, I
      trust, be the better sooner or later by me; for I think I foresee that
      Captain Walsingham, if a certain Spanish lady were out of the question,
      would propose for Amelia, and would persuade her to give up this foolish
      fancy of hers for that baronet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont shook her head, as if she believed this could not possibly
      be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, if it can't be, it can't. The girl's inclination must not be
      controlled. I don't wonder, however, that you are vexed at missing such a
      husband for her as young Walsingham. But, my good madam, we must make the
      best of it&mdash;let the girl marry her baronet. I have left a legacy of
      some thousands to Captain Walsingham, as a token of my esteem for his
      character; and I am sure, my dear Mrs. Beaumont, his interests are in good
      hands when I leave them in yours. In the mean time, I wish you, as the
      representative of my late good friend, Colonel Beaumont, to enjoy all I
      have during your life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont poured forth such a profusion of kind and grateful
      expressions, that Mr. Palmer was quite disconcerted. "No more of this, my
      dear madam, no more of this. But there was something I was going to say,
      that has gone out of my head. Oh, it was, that the Walsinghams will, I
      think, stand a good chance of being the better for me in another way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why you have seen so much more of them than I have&mdash;don't you, my
      dear madam, see that Miss Walsingham has made a conquest of your son? I
      thought I was remarkably slow at seeing these things, and yet I saw it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Walsingham is a prodigious favourite of mine. But you know Edward is
      so young, and men don't like, now-a-days, to marry young," said Mrs.
      Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, let them manage their affairs their own way," said Mr. Palmer; "all
      I wish upon earth is to see them happy, or rather to hear of their
      happiness, for I shall not see it you know in Jamaica."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" said Mrs. Beaumont, in a most affectionate tone, and with a sigh
      that seemed to come from her heart; "alas! that is such a melancholy
      thought."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Palmer ended the conversation by inquiring whom he had best ask to
      witness his will. Mrs. Beaumont proposed Captain Lightbody and Dr.
      Wheeler. The doctor was luckily in the house, for he had been sent for
      this morning, to see her poor Amelia, who had caught cold yesterday, and
      had a slight feverish complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was perfectly true. The anxiety that Amelia had suffered of late&mdash;the
      fear of being forced or ensnared to marry a man she disliked&mdash;apprehensions
      about the Spanish incognita, and at last the certainty that Captain
      Walsingham would not arrive before Mr. Palmer should have left England,
      and that consequently the hopes she had formed from this benevolent
      friend's interference were vain&mdash;all these things had overpowered
      Amelia; she had passed a feverish night, and was really ill. Mrs. Beaumont
      at any other time would have been much alarmed; for, duplicity out of the
      question, she was a fond mother: but she now was well contented that her
      daughter should have a day's confinement to her room, for the sake of
      keeping her safe out of the way. So leaving poor Amelia to her feverish
      thoughts, we proceed with the business of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Wheeler, Captain Lightbody, and Mr. Twigg witnessed the will; it was
      executed, and a copy of it deposited with Mrs. Beaumont. This was one
      great point gained. The next object was her jointure. She had employed her
      convenient tame man<a href="#linknote-3" name="linknoteref-3"
      id="linknoteref-3"><small>3</small></a>, Captain Lightbody, humbly to
      suggest to her son, that some increase of jointure would be proper; and
      she was now in anxiety to know how these hints, and others which had been
      made by more remote means, would operate. As she was waiting to see Mr.
      Lightbody in her dressing-room, to hear the result of his <i>suggestions</i>,
      the door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Lightbody! come in&mdash;what success?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped short, for it was not Captain Lightbody, it was her son.
      Without taking any notice of what she said, he advanced towards her, and
      presented a deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will do me the favour, mother, to accept of this addition to your
      jointure," said he. "It was always my intention to do this, the moment it
      should be in my power; and I had flattered myself that you would not have
      thought it necessary to suggest to me what I knew I ought to do, or to
      hint to me your wishes by any intermediate person."
    </p>
    <p>
      Colouring deeply, for it hurt her conscience to be found out, Mrs.
      Beaumont was upon the point of disavowing her emissary, but she
      recollected that the words which she had used when her son was coming into
      the room might have betrayed her. On the other hand, it was not certain
      that he had heard them. She hesitated. From the shame of a disavowal,
      which would have answered no purpose, but to sink her lower in her son's
      opinion, she was, however, saved by his abrupt sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't say any thing more about it, dear mother," cried he, "but pardon me
      the pain I have given you at a time when indeed I wished only to give
      pleasure. Promise me, that in future you will let me know your wishes
      directly, and from your own lips."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Undoubtedly&mdash;depend upon it, my dearest son. I am quite overpowered.
      The fact was, that I could not, however really and urgently necessary it
      was to me, bring myself to mention with my own lips what, as a direct
      request from me, I knew you could not and would not refuse, however
      inconvenient it might be to you to comply. On this account, and on this
      account only, I wished you not to know my wants from myself, but from an
      intermediate friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friend!"&mdash;Mr. Beaumont could not help repeating with an emphasis of
      disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Friend</i>, I only said by courtesy; but I wished you to know my wants
      from an intermediate person, that you might not feel yourself in any way
      bound, or called upon, and that the refusal might be implied and tacit, as
      it were, so that it could lead to no unpleasant feelings between us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! my dear mother," said Mr. Beaumont, "I have not your knowledge of the
      world, or of human nature; but from all I have heard, seen, and felt, I am
      convinced that more unpleasant feelings are created in families, by these
      false delicacies, and managements, and hints, and go-between friends by
      courtesy, than ever would have been caused by the parties speaking
      directly to one another, and telling the plain truth about their thoughts
      and wishes. Forgive me if I speak too plainly at this moment; as we are to
      live together, I hope, many years, it may spare us many an unhappy hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont wiped her eyes. Her son found it difficult to go on, and
      yet, upon his own principles, it was right to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amelia, ma'am! I find she is ill this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;poor child!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope, mother&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since," interrupted Mrs. Beaumont, "my dear son wishes always to hear
      from me the plain and direct truth, I must tell him, that, as the guardian
      of his sister, I think myself accountable to no one for my conduct with
      respect to her; and that I should look upon any interference as an unkind
      and unjustifiable doubt of my affection for my daughter. Rest satisfied
      with this assurance, that her happiness is, in all I do, my first object;
      and as I have told her a thousand times, no force shall be put on her
      inclinations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no more to say, no more to ask," said Mr. Beaumont. "This is a
      distinct, positive declaration, in which I will confide, and, in future,
      not suffer appearances to alarm me. A mother would not keep the word of
      promise to the ear, and break it to the hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont, feeling herself change countenance, made an attempt to blow
      her nose, and succeeded in hiding her face with her handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With respect to myself," continued Mr. Beaumont, "I should also say, lest
      you should be in any doubt concerning my sentiments, that though I have
      complied with your request to delay for a few weeks&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>That</i> you need not repeat, my dear," interrupted Mrs. Beaumont. "I
      understand all that perfectly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then at the end of this month I shall&mdash;and, I hope, with your entire
      approbation, propose for Miss Walsingham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Time enough," said Mrs. Beaumont, smiling, and tapping her son playfully
      on the shoulder, "time enough to talk of that when the end of the month
      comes. How often have I seen young men like you change their minds, and
      fall in and out of love in the course of one short month! At any rate,"
      continued Mrs. Beaumont, "let us pass to the order of the day; for we have
      time enough to settle other matters; but the order of the day&mdash;a
      tiresome one, I confess&mdash;is to settle accounts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am ready&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So am I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then let us go with the accounts to Mr. Palmer, who is also ready, I am
      sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, before we go," said Mrs. Beaumont, whispering, "let us settle what
      is to be said about the debts&mdash;<i>your</i> debts you know. I fancy
      you'll agree with me, that the less is said about this the better; and
      that, in short, the best will be to say nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so, madam? Surely you don't think I mean to conceal my debts from our
      friend Mr. Palmer, at the very moment when I profess to tell him all my
      affairs, and to settle accounts with him and you, as my guardians!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With him? But he has never acted, you know, as one of the guardians;
      therefore you are not called upon to settle accounts with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why, ma'am, did you urge him to come down from London, to be present
      at the settlement of these accounts?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a compliment, and because I wish him to be present, as your father's
      friend; but it is by no means essential that he should know every detail."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do whichever you please, ma'am; I will either settle accounts with
      or without him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! <i>with</i> him, that is, in his presence, to be sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then he must know the whole."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so? Your having contracted such debts will alter his opinion of your
      prudence and of mine, and may, perhaps, essentially alter&mdash;alter&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His will? Be it so; that is the worst that can happen. As far as I am
      concerned, I would rather a thousand times it were so, than deceive him
      into a better opinion of me than I deserve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobly said! so like yourself, and like every thing I could wish: but,
      forgive me, if I did for you, what indeed I would not wish you to do for
      yourself. I have already told Mr. Palmer that you had no embarrassments;
      therefore, you cannot, and I am sure would not, unsay what I have said."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaumont stood fixed in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why, mother, did not you tell him the whole?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear love, delicacy prevented me. He offered to relieve you from any
      embarrassments, if you had any; but I, having too much delicacy and pride
      to let my son put himself under pecuniary obligations, hastily answered,
      that you had no debts; for there was no other reply to be made, without
      offending poor Palmer, and hurting his generous feelings, which I would
      not do for the universe: and I considered too, that as all Palmer's
      fortune will come to us in the end&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, ma'am," interrupted Mr. Beaumont, impatient of all these glosses
      and excuses, "the plain state of the case is, that I cannot contradict
      what my mother has said; therefore I will not settle accounts at all with
      Mr. Palmer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what excuse <i>can</i> I make to him, after sending for him express
      from London?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I must leave to you, mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what reason <i>can</i> I give for thus withdrawing our
      family-confidence from such an old friend, and at the very moment when he
      is doing so much for us all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I must leave to you, mother. I withdraw no confidence. I have
      pretended none&mdash;I will break none."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens! was not all I did and said for <i>your</i> interest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing can be for my interest that is not for my honour, and for yours,
      mother. But let us never go over the business again. Now to the order of
      the day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, dear son," said Mrs. Beaumont, "don't speak so roughly, so
      cruelly to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly softened, by seeing the tears standing in his mother's eyes, he
      besought her pardon for the bluntness of his manner, and expressed his
      entire belief in her affection and zeal for his interests; but, on the
      main point, that he would not deceive Mr. Palmer, or directly or
      indirectly assert a falsehood, Mr. Beaumont was immoveable. In the midst
      of her entreaties a message came from Mr. Palmer, to say that he was
      waiting for the accounts, which Mrs. Beaumont wished to settle. "Well,"
      said she, much perplexed, "well, come down to him&mdash;come, for it is
      impossible for me to find any excuse after sending for him from London; he
      would think there was something worse than there really is. Stay&mdash;I'll
      go down first, and sound him; and if it won't do without the accounts, do
      you come when I ring the bell; then all I have for it is to run my chance.
      Perhaps he may never recollect what passed about your debts, for the dear
      good old soul has not the best memory in the world; and if he should
      obstinately remember, why, after all, it's only a bit of false delicacy,
      and a white lie for a friend and a son, and we can colour it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Down went Mrs. Beaumont to sound Mr. Palmer; but though much might be
      expected from her address, yet she found it unequal to the task of
      convincing this gentleman's plain good sense that it would fatigue him to
      see those accounts, which he came so many miles on purpose to settle.
      Perceiving him begin to waken to the suspicion that she had some interest
      in suppressing the accounts, and hearing him, in an altered tone, ask,
      "Madam, is there any mystery in these accounts, that I must not see them?"
      she instantly rang the bell, and answered, "Oh, none; none in the world;
      only we thought&mdash;that is, I feared it might fatigue you too much, my
      dear friend, just the day before your journey, and I was unwilling to lose
      so many hours of your good company; but since you are so very kind&mdash;here's
      my son and the papers."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "A face untaught to feign; a judging eye, That darts severe upon a rising
      lie, And strikes a blush through frontless flattery."
    </p>
    <p>
      To the settlement of accounts they sat down in due form; and it so
      happened, that though this dear good old soul had not the best memory in
      the world, yet he had an obstinate recollection of every word Mrs.
      Beaumont had said about her son's having no debts or embarrassments. And
      great and unmanageable was his astonishment, when the truth came to light.
      "It is not," said he, turning to Mr. Beaumont, "that I am astonished at
      your having debts; I am sorry for that, to be sure; but young men are
      often a little extravagant or so, and I dare say&mdash;particularly as you
      are so candid and make no excuses about it&mdash;I dare say you will be
      more prudent in future, and give up the race-horses as you promise. But&mdash;why
      did not Madam Beaumont tell me the truth? Why make a mystery, when I
      wanted nothing but to serve my friends? It was not using me well&mdash;it
      was not using yourself well. Madam, madam, I am vexed to the heart, and
      would not for a thousand pounds&mdash;ay, fool as I am, not for ten
      thousand pounds, this had happened to me from my good friend the colonel's
      widow&mdash;a man that would as soon have cut his hand off. Oh, madam!
      Madam Beaumont! you have struck me a hard blow at my time of life. Any
      thing but this I could have borne; but to have one's confidence and old
      friendships shaken at my time of life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont was, in her turn, in unfeigned astonishment; for Mr. Palmer
      took the matter more seriously, and seemed more hurt by this discovery of
      a trifling deviation from truth, than she had foreseen, or than she could
      have conceived to be possible, in a case where neither his interest nor
      any one of his passions was concerned. It was in vain that she palliated
      and explained, and talked of delicacy, and generosity, and pride, and
      maternal feelings, and the feelings of a friend, and all manner of fine
      and double-refined sentiments; still Mr. Palmer's sturdy plain sense could
      not be made to comprehend that a falsehood is not a falsehood, or that
      deceiving a friend is using him well. Her son suffered for her, as his
      countenance and his painful and abashed silence plainly showed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And does not even my son say any thing for me? Is this friendly?" said
      she, unable to enter into his feelings, and thinking that the part of a
      friend was to make apologies, right or wrong.&mdash;Mr. Palmer shook hands
      with Mr. Beaumont, and, without uttering a syllable, they understood one
      another perfectly. Mr. Beaumont left the room; and Mrs. Beaumont burst
      into tears. Mr. Palmer, with great good-nature, tried to assuage that
      shame and compunction which he imagined that she felt. He observed, that,
      to be sure, she must feel mortified and vexed with herself, but that he
      was persuaded nothing but some mistaken notion of delicacy could have led
      her to do what her principles must condemn. Immediately she said all that
      she saw would please Mr. Palmer; and following the lead of his mind, she
      at last confirmed him in the opinion, that this was an accidental not an
      habitual deviation from truth. His confidence in her was broken, but not
      utterly destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to the debt," resumed Mr. Palmer, "do not let that give you a moment's
      concern; I will put that out of the question in a few minutes. My share in
      the cargo of the Anne, which I see is just safely arrived in the Downs,
      will more than pay this debt. Your son shall enter upon his estate
      unencumbered. No, no&mdash;don't thank me; I won't cheat you of your
      thanks; it is your son must thank me for this. I do it on his account. I
      like the young man. There is an ingenuousness, an honourable frankness
      about him, that I love. Instead of his bond for the money, I shall ask his
      promise never to have any thing more to do with race-horses or Newmarket;
      and his promise I shall think as good as if it were his bond. Now I am not
      throwing money away; I'm not doing an idle ostentatious thing, but one
      that may, and I hope will, be essentially useful. For, look you here, my
      good&mdash;look here, Mrs. Beaumont: a youth who finds himself encumbered
      with debt on coming to his estate is apt to think of freeing himself by
      marrying a fortune instead of a woman; now instead of freeing a man, this
      fetters him for life: and what sort of a friend must that be, who, if he
      could prevent it, would let this be done for a few thousand pounds? So
      I'll go before I take another pinch of snuff, and draw him an order upon
      the cargo of the Anne, lest I should forget it in the hurry of packing and
      taking leave, and all those uncomfortable things."
    </p>
    <p>
      He left <i>Madam</i> Beaumont to her feelings, or her reflections; and, in
      a few minutes, with an order for the money in his hand, went over the
      house in search of his young friend. Mr. Beaumont came out of his sister's
      room on hearing himself called.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here," said Mr. Palmer, "is a little business for you to do. Read this
      order over; see that it is right, and endorse it&mdash;mind&mdash;and
      never let me hear one word more about it&mdash;only by way of
      acknowledgment&mdash;ask your mother what you are to give me. But don't
      read it till you are out of my sight&mdash;Is Amelia up? Can I see her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; up and in her dressing-room. Do, dear sir, go in and see her, for my
      mother says she is too feverish to leave her room to-day; but I am sure
      that it will make her ten times worse to be prevented from seeing you the
      last day you are with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does the little gipsy then care so much for me?&mdash;that's fair; for I
      am her friend, and will prove it to her, by giving up my own fancies to
      hers: so trust me with her, <i>tête-à-tête</i>,&mdash;young gentleman; go
      off, if you please, and do your own business."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Palmer knocked at Amelia's door, and fancying he heard an answer of
      admittance, went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Palmer, my good Mr. Palmer, is it you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but you seem not above half to know whether you are glad or sorry to
      see your good Mr. Palmer; for while you hold out your hand, you turn away
      your face from me.&mdash;Dear, dear! what a burning hand, and how the
      pulse goes and flutters! What does Dr. Wheeler say to this? I am a bit of
      a physician myself&mdash;let me look at you. What's this? eyes as red as
      ferret's&mdash;begging your eyes' pardon, young lady&mdash;What's this
      about? Come," said he, drawing a chair and sitting down close beside her,
      "no mysteries&mdash;no mysteries&mdash;I hate mysteries&mdash;besides, we
      have not time for them. Consider, I go to-morrow, and have all my shirts
      to pack up: ay, smile, lady, as your father used to do; and open your
      whole heart to me, as he always did. Consider me as an old friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do consider you as a sincere, excellent friend," said Amelia; "but&mdash;"
      Amelia knew that she could not explain herself without disobeying, and
      perhaps betraying, her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No <i>buts</i>," said Mr. Palmer, taking hold of her hand. "Come, my
      little Amelia, before you have put that ring on and off your pretty finger
      fifty times more, tell me whom you would wish to put a ring on this finger
      for life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! that is the thing <i>I cannot</i> tell you!" said Amelia. "Were I
      alone concerned, I would tell you every thing; but&mdash;ask me no more, I
      cannot tell you the whole truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then there's something wrong somewhere or other. Whenever people tell me
      they cannot speak the truth, I always say, then there's something wrong.
      Give me leave, Amelia, to ask&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't question me," said Amelia: "talk to my mother. I don't know how I
      ought to answer you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Not know how!</i> 'Fore George! this is strange! A strange house,
      where one can't get at the simplest truth without a world of difficulty&mdash;mother
      and daughter all alike; not one of 'em but the son can, for the soul of
      'em, give a plain answer to a plain question. <i>Not know how!</i> as if
      it was a science to tell the truth. Not know how! as if a person could not
      talk to me, honest old Richard Palmer, without <i>knowing how!</i> as if
      it was how to baffle a lawyer on a cross-examination&mdash;<i>Not know how</i>
      to answer one's own friend! Ah! this is not the way your father and I used
      to go on, Miss Beaumont. Nay, nay, don't cry now, or that will finish
      oversetting the little temper I have left, for I can't bear to see a woman
      cry, especially a young woman like you; it breaks my heart, old as it is,
      and fool that I am, that ought to know your sex better by this time than
      to let a few tears drown my common sense. Well, young lady, be that as it
      may, since you won't tell me your mind, I must tell you your mind, for I
      happen to know it&mdash;Yes, I do&mdash;your mother bid me spare your
      delicacy, and I would, but that I have not time; besides, I don't
      understand, nor see what good is got, but a great deal of mischief, by
      these cursed new-fashioned delicacies: wherefore, in plain English, I tell
      you, I don't like Sir John Hunter, and I do like Captain Walsingham; and I
      did wish you married to Captain Walsingham&mdash;you need not start so,
      for I say <i>did</i>&mdash;I don't wish it now; for since your heart is
      set upon Sir John Hunter, God forbid I should want to give Captain
      Walsingham a wife without a heart. So I have only to add, that
      notwithstanding my own fancy or judgment, I have done my best to persuade
      your mother to let you have the man, or the baronet, of your choice. I
      will go farther: I'll make it a point with her, and bring you both
      together; for there's no other way, I see, of understanding you; and get a
      promise of her consent; and then I hope I shall leave you all satisfied,
      and without any mysteries. And, in the mean time," added Mr. Palmer,
      taking out of his coat pocket a morocco leather case, and throwing it down
      on the table before Amelia, "every body should be made happy their own
      way: there are some diamonds for Lady Hunter, and God bless you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sir, stay!" cried Amelia, rising eagerly; "dear, good Mr. Palmer,
      keep your diamonds, and leave me your esteem and love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I can't, unless you speak openly to me. It is out of nature. Don't
      kneel&mdash;don't. God bless you! young lady, you have my pity; for
      indeed," turning and looking at her, "you seem very miserable, and look
      very sincere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If my mother was here!&mdash;I <i>must</i> see my mother," exclaimed
      Amelia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's the difficulty? I'll go for her this instant," said Mr. Palmer,
      who was not a man to let a romance trail on to six volumes for want of
      going six yards; or for want of somebody's coming into a room at the right
      minute for explanation; or from some of those trivial causes by which
      adepts contrive to delude us at the very moment of expectation. Whilst Mr.
      Palmer was going for Mrs. Beaumont, Amelia waited in terrible anxiety. The
      door was open; and as she looked into the gallery which led to her room,
      she saw Mr. Palmer and her mother as they came along, talking together.
      Knowing every symptom of suppressed passion in her mother's countenance,
      she was quite terrified, by indications which passed unnoticed by Mr.
      Palmer. As her mother approached, Amelia hid her face in her hands for a
      moment, but gaining courage from the consciousness of integrity, and from
      a determination to act openly, she looked up; and, rising with dignity,
      said, in a gentle but firm voice&mdash;"Mother, I hope you will not think
      that there is any impropriety in my speaking to our friend, Mr. Palmer,
      with the same openness with which I have always spoken to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear child," interrupted Mrs. Beaumont, embracing Amelia with a sudden
      change of manner and countenance, "my sweet child, I have tried you to the
      utmost; forgive me; all your trials now are over, and you must allow me
      the pleasure of telling our excellent friend, Mr. Palmer, what I know will
      delight him almost as much as it delights me&mdash;that the choice of
      Amelia's heart, Mr. Palmer, is worthy of her, just what we all wished."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Captain Walsingham?" exclaimed Mr. Palmer, with joyful astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, my love," said Mrs. Beaumont, seating Amelia, who, from the
      surprise at this sudden change in her mother, and from the confusion of
      feelings which overwhelmed her at this moment, was near fainting: "we are
      too much for her, I have been too abrupt," continued Mrs. Beaumont: "Open
      the window, will you, my good sir? and," whispering, "let us not say any
      more to her at present; you see it won't do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am well, quite well again, now," said Amelia, exerting herself. "Don't
      leave, don't forsake me, Mr. Palmer; pray don't go," holding out her hand
      to Mr. Palmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Amelia," said Mrs. Beaumont, "don't talk, don't exert yourself;
      pray lie still on the sofa."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her colour is come back; she looks like herself again," said Mr. Palmer,
      seating himself beside her, regardless of Mrs. Beaumont's prohibitory
      looks. "Since my little Amelia wished me to stay, I'll not go. So, my
      child&mdash;but I won't hurry you&mdash;only want one sign of the head to
      confirm the truth of what your mother has just told me, for nobody can
      tell what passes in a young lady's heart but herself. So then, it is not
      that sprig of quality, that selfish spendthrift, that Sir John Hunter, who
      has your heart&mdash;hey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, no," answered Amelia; "I never did, I never could like such a
      man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I thought not&mdash;I thought it was impossible; but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont, alarmed beyond conception, suddenly put her hand before Mr.
      Palmer's mouth, to prevent him from finishing his sentence, and exposing
      the whole of her shameful duplicity to her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absolutely I must, and do hereby interpose my maternal authority, and
      forbid all agitating explanations whilst Amelia is in her present state.
      Dr. Wheeler says she is terribly feverish. Come, Mr. Palmer, I must carry
      you off by force, and from me you shall have all the explanations and all
      the satisfaction you can require."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Mr. Palmer, "good bye for the present, my little Amelia, my
      darling little Amelia! I am so delighted to find that Captain Walsingham's
      the man, and so glad you have no mysteries: be well, be well soon. I am so
      pleased, so happy, that I am as unruly as a child, and as easily managed.
      You see, how I let myself be turned out of the room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not turned out, only carried out," said Mrs. Beaumont, who never, even in
      the most imminent perils, lost her polite presence of mind. Having thus
      carried off Mr. Palmer, she was in hopes that, in the joyful confusion of
      his mind, he would he easily satisfied with any plausible explanation.
      Therefore she dexterously fixed his attention on the future, and adverted
      as slightly as possible to the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, my good sir, congratulate me," said she, "on the prospect I have of
      happiness in such a son-in-law as Captain Walsingham, if it be indeed true
      that Captain Walsingham is really attached to Amelia. But, on the other
      hand, what shall we do if there is any truth in the story of the Spanish
      lady? Oh, there's the difficulty! Between hope and fear, I am in such a
      distracted state at this moment, I hardly know what I say. What shall we
      do about the Spanish lady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do, my dear madam! we can do nothing at all in that case: but I will hope
      the best, and you'll see that he will prove a constant man at last. In the
      mean time, how was all that about Sir John Hunter, and what are you to do
      with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave that to me; I will settle all that," cried Mrs. Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I hope the poor man, though I don't like him, has not been jilted?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, by no means; Amelia's incapable of that. You know she told you just
      now that she never liked him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay; but I think, madam, you told me, that she <i>did</i>," said Mr.
      Palmer, sticking to his point with a decided plainness, which quite
      disconcerted Mrs. Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was all a mistake," said she, "quite a mistake; and I am sure you
      rejoice with me that it was so: and, as to the rest&mdash;past blunders,
      like past misfortunes, are good for nothing but to be forgotten."
    </p>
    <p>
      Observing that Mr. Palmer looked dissatisfied, Mrs. Beaumont continued
      apologizing. "I confess you have to all appearance some cause to be angry
      with me," said she: "but now only hear me. Taking the blame upon myself,
      let me candidly tell you the whole truth, and all my reasons, foolish
      perhaps as they were. Captain Walsingham behaved so honourably, and had
      such command over his feelings, that I, who am really the most credulous
      creature in the world, was so completely deceived, that I fancied he never
      had a thought of Amelia, and that he never would think of her; and I own
      this roused both my pride and my prudence for my daughter; and I certainly
      thought it my duty, as her mother, to do every thing in my power to
      discourage in her young and innocent heart a hopeless passion. It was but
      within these few hours that I have been undeceived by you as to his
      sentiments. That, of course, made an immediate change, as you have seen,
      in my measures; for such is my high opinion of the young man, and indeed
      my desire to be connected with the Walsinghams is so great, that even
      whilst I am in total ignorance of what the amount or value may be of this
      prize that he has taken, and even whilst I am in doubt concerning this
      Spanish incognita, I have not hesitated to declare, perhaps imprudently,
      to Amelia, as you have just heard, my full approbation of the choice of
      her heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hum!&mdash;well&mdash;hey!&mdash;How's this?" said Mr. Palmer to himself,
      as he tried to believe and to be satisfied with this apology. "Madam,"
      said he aloud to Mrs. Beaumont, "I comprehend that it might not be prudent
      to encourage Amelia's partiality for Captain Walsingham till you were sure
      of the young man's sentiments; but, excuse me, I am a very slow,
      unpractised man in these matters; I don't yet understand why you told <i>me</i>
      that she was in love with Sir John Hunter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont, being <i>somewhat in the habit of self-contradiction</i>,
      was seldom unprovided with a concordance of excuses; but at this unlucky
      moment she was found unprepared. Hesitating she stood, all subtle as she
      was, deprived of ready wit, and actually abashed in the presence of a
      plain good man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I candidly confess, my dear sir," said she, apologizing to Mr. Palmer as
      he walked up and down, "that my delicacy or pride,&mdash;call it what you
      will,&mdash;my false pride for my daughter, led me into an error. I could
      not bring myself to acknowledge to any man, even to you&mdash;for you know
      that it's contrary quite to the principles and pride of our sex&mdash;that
      she felt any partiality for a man who had shown none for her. You must be
      sensible it was, to say no more, an awkward, mortifying thing; and I was
      so afraid even of your finding it out, that&mdash;forgive me&mdash;I did,
      I candidly acknowledge, fabricate the foolish story of Sir John Hunter.
      But, believe me, I never seriously thought of her marrying him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Fore George! I don't understand one word of it from beginning to end,"
      said Mr. Palmer, speaking aloud to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of the profusion of words which Mrs. Beaumont continued pouring
      forth, he seated himself in an arm-chair, and, deep in reverie for some
      minutes, went on slowly striking his hands together, as he leaned with his
      arms on his knees. At length he rose, rang the bell, and said to the
      servant, "Sir, be so obliging as to let my man Crichton know that he need
      not hurry himself to pack up my clothes, for I shall not go to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Struck with consternation at these words, Mrs. Beaumont, nevertheless,
      commanded the proper expression of joy on the occasion. "Delightful! I
      must go this instant," cried she, "and be the first to tell this charming
      news to Amelia and Edward."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell them, then, madam, if you please, that I have gained such a conquest
      over what Mr. Walsingham calls my hypochondriacism, that I am determined,
      at whatever risk, to stay another year in Old England, and that I hope to
      be present at both their weddings."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont's quick exit was at this moment necessary to conceal her
      dismay. Instead of going to Amelia, she hurried to her own room, locked
      the door, and sat down to compose her feelings and to collect her
      thoughts; but scarcely had she been two minutes in her apartment, when a
      messenger came to summon her to the festive scene in the park. The tenants
      and villagers were all at dinner, and Mr. Beaumont sent to let her know
      that they were waiting to drink her health. She was obliged to go, and to
      appear all radiant with pleasure. The contrast between their honest mirth
      and her secret sufferings was great. She escaped as soon as she could from
      their <i>senseless</i> joy, and again shut herself up in her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sudden and totally unexpected resolution of Mr. Palmer's so
      astonished her, that she could scarcely believe she had heard or
      understood his words rightly. Artful persons may, perhaps, calculate with
      expertness and accuracy what will, in any given case, be the
      determinations of the selfish and the interested; but they are liable to
      frequent mistakes in judging of the open-hearted and the generous: there
      is no sympathy to guide them, and all their habits tend to mislead them in
      forming opinions of the direct and sincere. It had never entered into Mrs.
      Beaumont's imagination that Mr. Palmer would, notwithstanding his belief
      that he hazarded his life by so doing, defer a whole year returning to
      Jamaica, merely to secure the happiness of her son and daughter. She
      plainly saw that he now suspected her dislike to the Walsinghams, and her
      aversion to the double union with that family: she saw that the slightest
      circumstance in her conduct, which confirmed his suspicions, would not
      only utterly ruin her in his opinion, but might induce him to alter that
      part of his will which left her sole possessor of his fortune during her
      life. Bad as her affairs were at this moment, she knew that they might
      still be worse. She recollected the letter of <i>perfect approbation</i>
      which Sir John Hunter had in his power. She foresaw that he would produce
      this letter on the first rumour of her favouring another lover for Amelia.
      She had just declared to Mr. Palmer, that she never seriously thought of
      Sir John Hunter for her daughter; and, should this letter be brought to
      light, she must be irremediably convicted of the basest duplicity, and
      there would be no escape from the shame of falsehood, or rather the
      disgrace of detection. In this grand difficulty, Mrs. Beaumont was too
      good a politician to waste time upon any inferior considerations. Instead
      of allowing herself leisure to reflect that all her present difficulties
      arose from her habits of insincerity, she, with the true spirit of
      intrigue, attributed her disappointments to some deficiency of artifice.
      "Oh!" said she to herself, "why did I <i>write?</i> I should only have <i>spoken</i>
      to Sir John. How could I be so imprudent as to <i>commit</i> myself by
      writing? But what can be done to repair this error?"
    </p>
    <p>
      One web destroyed, she, with indefatigable subtlety, began to weave
      another. With that promptitude of invention which practice alone can give,
      she devised a scheme, by which she hoped not only to prevent Sir John
      Hunter from producing the written proof of her duplicity, but by which she
      could also secure the reversionary title, and the great Wigram estate. The
      nature of the scheme shall be unfolded in the next chapter; and it will
      doubtless procure for Mrs. Beaumont, from all proper judges, a just
      tribute of admiration. They will allow our heroine to be possessed not
      only of that address, which is the peculiar glory of female politicians,
      but also of that masculine quality, which the greatest, wisest, of mankind
      has pronounced to be the first, second, and third requisite for business&mdash;"Boldness&mdash;boldness&mdash;boldness."

      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "The creature's at her dirty work again."&mdash;POPE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst the infinite petty points of cunning of which that great practical
      philosopher Bacon has in vain essayed to make out a list, he notes that,
      "Because it worketh better when any thing seemeth to be gotten from you by
      question than if you offer it of yourself: you may lay a bait for a
      question, by showing another visage and countenance than you are wont, to
      the end to give occasion to the party to ask what the matter is of the
      change."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter, my dearest Mrs. Beaumont? I never saw you look so sad
      before in all my life," said Miss Hunter, meeting Mrs. Beaumont, who had
      walked out into the park on purpose to be so met, and in hopes of having
      the melancholy of her countenance thus observed. It was the more striking,
      and the more unseasonable, from its contrast with the gay scene in the
      park. The sound of music was heard, and the dancing had begun, and all was
      rural festivity: "What is the matter, my dearest Mrs. Beaumont?" repeated
      Miss Hunter; "at such a time as this to see you look so melancholy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! my love! such a sad change in affairs! But," whispered Mrs. Beaumont,
      "I cannot explain myself before your companion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lightbody was walking with Miss Hunter: but he was so complaisant,
      that he was easily despatched on some convenient errand; and then Mrs.
      Beaumont, with all her wonted delicacy of circumlocution, began to
      communicate her distress to her young friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know, my beloved Albina," said she, "it has been my most ardent wish
      that your brother should be connected with my family by the nearest and
      dearest ties."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; that is, married to Amelia," said Miss Hunter. "And has any thing
      happened to prevent it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear! it is all over! It cannot be&mdash;must not be thought of&mdash;must
      not be spoken of any more; Mr. Palmer has been outrageous about it. Such a
      scene as I have had! and all to no purpose. Amelia has won him over to her
      party. Only conceive what I felt&mdash;she declared, beyond redemption,
      her preference of Captain Walsingham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before the captain proposed for her! How odd! dear! Suppose he should
      never propose for her, what a way she will be in after affronting my
      brother and all! And only think! she gives up the title, and the great
      Wigram estate, and every thing. Why, my brother says, uncle Wigram can't
      live three months; and Lord Puckeridge's title, too, will come to my
      brother, you know; and Amelia might have been Lady Puckeridge. Only think!
      did you ever know any thing so foolish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!" said Mrs. Beaumont; "but you know, my dear, so few girls have the
      sense you show in taking advice: they all will judge for themselves. But
      I'm most hurt by Amelia's want of gratitude and delicacy towards <i>me</i>,"
      continued Mrs. Beaumont; "only conceive the difficulty and distress in
      which she has left me about your poor brother. Such a shock as the
      disappointment will be to him! And he may&mdash;though Heaven knows how
      little I deserve it&mdash;he may suspect&mdash;for men, when they are
      vexed and angry, will, you know, suspect even their best friends; he
      might, I say, suspect me of not being warm in his cause."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, no! I have always told him how kind you were, and how much you
      wished the thing; and of all people in the world he can't blame you,
      dearest Mrs. Beaumont."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant Mrs. Beaumont saw a glimpse of somebody in a bye-path of
      the shrubbery near them. "Hush! Take care! Who is that lurking there? Some
      listener! Who can it be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hunter applied her glass to her eye, but could not make out who it
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is Lightbody, I declare," said Mrs. Beaumont. "Softly,&mdash;let us
      not pretend to see him, and watch what he will do. It is of the greatest
      consequence to me to know whether he is a listener or not; so much as he
      is about the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      An irresistible fit of giggling, which seized Miss Hunter at the odd way
      in which Lightbody walked, prevented Mrs. Beaumont's trial of his
      curiosity. At the noise which the young lady made, Mr. Lightbody turned
      his head, and immediately advancing, with his accustomed mixture of
      effrontery and servility, said, that "he had executed Mrs. Beaumont's
      commands, and that he had returned in hopes of getting a moment to say a
      word to her when she was at leisure, about something he had just learned
      from Mr. Palmer's man Crichton, which it was of consequence she should
      know without delay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thank you, you best of creatures; but I know all that already."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know that Mr. Palmer does not go to-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; and am so rejoiced at it! Do, my dear Lightbody, go to Amelia and my
      son from me, and tell them that charming news. And after that, pray have
      the compassion to inquire if the post is not come in yet, and run over the
      papers, to see if you can find any thing about Walsingham's prize."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lightbody obeyed, but not with his usual alacrity. Mrs. Beaumont mused
      for a moment, and then said, "I do believe he was listening. What could he
      be doing there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doing!&mdash;Oh, nothing," said Miss Hunter: "he's never doing any thing,
      you know; and as to listening, he was so far off he could not hear a word
      we said: besides, he is such a simple creature, and loves you so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," said Mrs. Beaumont; "he either did not play me fair, or
      else he did a job I employed him in this morning so awkwardly, that I
      never wish to employ him again. He is but a <i>low</i> kind of person,
      after all; I'll get rid of him: that sort of people always grow tiresome
      and troublesome after a time, and one must shake them off. But I have not
      leisure to think of him now&mdash;Well, my dear, to go on with what I was
      saying to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont went on talking of her friendship for Sir John Hunter, and
      of the difficulty of appeasing him; but observing that Miss Hunter
      listened only with forced attention, she paused to consider what this
      could mean. Habitually suspicious, like all insincere people, Mrs.
      Beaumont now began to imagine that there was some plot carrying on against
      her by Sir John Hunter and Lightbody, and that Miss Hunter was made use of
      against her. Having a most contemptible opinion of her Albina's
      understanding, and knowing that her young friend had too little capacity
      to be able to deceive her, or to invent a plausible excuse impromptu, Mrs.
      Beaumont turned quick, and exclaimed, "My dear, what could Lightbody be
      saying to you when I came up?&mdash;for I remember he stopped short, and
      you both looked so guilty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guilty! did I?&mdash;Did he?&mdash;Dearest Mrs. Beaumont, don't look at
      me so with your piercing eyes!&mdash;Oh! I vow and protest I can't tell
      you; I won't tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady tittered, and twisted herself into various affected
      attitudes; then kissing Mrs. Beaumont, and then turning her back with
      childish playfulness, she cried, "No, I won't tell you; never, never,
      never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, my dear, don't trifle; I have really business to do, and am
      in a hurry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, don't look at me&mdash;never look at me again&mdash;promise me
      that, and I'll tell you. Poor Lightbody&mdash;Oh, you're looking at me!&mdash;Poor
      Lightbody was talking to me of <i>somebody</i>, and he laid me a wager&mdash;but
      I can't tell you that&mdash;Ah, don't be angry with me, and I will tell,
      if you'll turn your head quite away!&mdash;that I should be married to <i>somebody</i>
      before the end of this year. Oh, now, don't look at me, dearest, dearest
      Mrs. Beaumont."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You dear little simpleton, and was that all?" said Mrs. Beaumont, vexed
      to have wasted her time upon such folly: "come, be serious now, my dear;
      if you knew the anxiety I am in at this moment&mdash;" But wisely judging
      that it would be in vain to hope for any portion of the love-sick damsel's
      attention, until she had confirmed her hopes of being married to <i>somebody</i>
      before the end of the year, Mrs. Beaumont scrupled not to throw out
      assurances, in which she had herself no further faith. After what she had
      heard from her son this morning, she must have been convinced that there
      was no chance of marrying him to Miss Hunter; she knew indeed positively,
      that he would soon declare his real attachment, but she could, she
      thought, during the interval retain her power over Miss Hunter, and secure
      her services, by concealing the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before I say one word more of my own affairs, let me, my dearest child,
      assure you, that in the midst of all these disappointments and
      mortifications about Amelia, I am supported by the hope&mdash;by something
      more than the hope&mdash;that I shall see the daughter of my heart happily
      settled soon: Lightbody does not want penetration, I see. But I am not at
      liberty to say more. So now, my dear, help me with all your cleverness to
      consider what I shall do in the difficulties I am in at this moment. Your
      brother has a letter of mine, approving, and so forth, his addresses to my
      daughter; now, if he, in the first rashness of his anger, should produce
      this to Palmer, I'm undone&mdash;or to my son, worse and worse! there
      would be a duel between them infallibly, for Beaumont is so warm on any
      point of honour&mdash;Oh, I dread to think of it, my dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So do I, I'm sure; but, Lord, I'm the worst person to think in a hurry&mdash;But
      can't you write a letter? for you always know what to say so well&mdash;And
      after all, do you know, I don't think he'll be half so angry or <i>so
      disappointed</i> as you fancy, for I never thought he was so much in love
      with Amelia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, if it was not a secret, I could tell you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? No secrets between us, my darling child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I can tell you, that just before he proposed for Amelia, he was
      consulting with me about proposing for Mrs. Dutton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Dutton, the widow! Mrs. Dutton! How you astonish me!" said Mrs.
      Beaumont (though she knew this before). "Why she is older than I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Older! yes, a great deal; but then you know my brother is no chicken
      himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure, compared with you, my dear, he is not young. There's a
      prodigious difference between you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Above twenty years; <i>for,</i> you know, he's by another marriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True; but I can't believe he proposed for Mrs. Dutton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not actually proposed, because I would not let him; for I should have
      hated to have had such an unfashionable-looking woman for my
      sister-in-law. I never could have borne to go into public with her, you
      know: so I plagued my brother out of it; and luckily he found out that her
      jointure is not half so great as it was said to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could have told him that. Mrs. Dutton's jointure is nothing nearly so
      large as mine was, even before the addition to it which my son so
      handsomely, and indeed unexpectedly, made to it this morning. And did I
      tell you, my dear? Mr. Palmer, this day, has been so kind as to leave me
      all his immense fortune for my own life. But don't mention it, lest it
      should get round, and make ill-will: the Walsinghams know nothing of it.
      But to return to your poor brother&mdash;if I could any way serve him with
      Mrs. Dutton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "La! he'd never think of her more&mdash;and I'm sure I would not have
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You dear little saucy creature! indeed I cannot wonder that you don't
      like the thoughts of Mrs. Dutton for a <i>chaperon</i> in town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, horrid! horrid!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet, would you condemn your poor brother to be an old bachelor, after
      this disappointment with Amelia?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "La, ma'am, can't he marry any body but Mrs. Dutton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I could think of any person would suit him. Can you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I know very well who I think would suit him, and one I like to go
      into public with of all things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And one who has promised to present me at court next winter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dearest child! is it possible that you mean me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do;&mdash;and why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not! My sweet love, do you consider my age?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you look so young."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure Mrs. Dutton looks older, and is older; but I could not bring
      myself, especially after being a widow so long, to think of marrying a
      young man&mdash;to be sure, your brother is not what one should call a
      very young man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, no; you don't look above three, or four, or five years older than
      he does; and in public, and with dress, and rouge, and fashion, and all
      that, I think it would do vastly well, and nobody would think it odd at
      all. There's Lady &mdash;&mdash;, is not she ten years older than Lord
      &mdash;&mdash;? and every body says that's nothing, and that she gives the
      most delightful parties. Oh, I declare, dearest Mrs. Beaumont, you must
      and shall marry my brother, and that's the only way to make him amends,
      and prevent mischief between the gentlemen; the only way to settle every
      thing charmingly&mdash;and I shall so like it&mdash;and I'm so proud of
      its being my plan! I vow, I'll go and write to my brother this minute, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay, you dear mad creature; only consider what you are about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Consider! I have considered, and I must and will have my own way," said
      the dear mad creature, struggling with Mrs. Beaumont, who detained her
      with an earnest hand. "My love," said she, "I positively cannot let you
      use my name in such a strange way. If your brother or the world should
      think I had any share in the transaction, it would be so indelicate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indelicate! Dear me, ma'am, but when nobody will know it, how can it be
      indelicate? and I will not mention your name, and nobody will ever imagine
      that you knew any thing of my writing; and I shall manage it all my own
      way; and the plan is all my own: so let me go and write this minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mercy upon me! what shall I do with this dear headstrong creature!" said
      Mrs. Beaumont, letting Miss Hunter go, as if exhausted by the struggle she
      had made to detain her impetuous young friend. Away ran Miss Hunter,
      sometimes looking back in defiance and laughing, whilst Mrs. Beaumont
      shook her head at her whenever she looked back, but found it impossible to
      overtake her, and vain to make further opposition. As Mrs. Beaumont walked
      slowly homewards, she meditated her own epistle to Sir John Hunter, and
      arranged her future plan of operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, thought she, Miss Hunter's letter should not succeed, it is only a
      suggestion of hers, of which I am not supposed to know any thing, and I am
      only just where I was before. If it does succeed, and if Sir John
      transfers his addresses to me, I avoid all danger of his anger on account
      of his disappointment with Amelia; for it must then be his play, to
      convince me that he is not at all disappointed, and then I shall have
      leisure to consider whether I shall marry Sir John or not. At all events,
      I can draw on his courtship as long as I please, till I have by degrees
      brought Mr. Palmer round to approve of the match.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these views Mrs. Beaumont wrote an incomparable letter to Sir John
      Hunter, in which she enveloped her meaning in so many words, and so much
      sentiment, that it was scarcely possible to comprehend any thing, except,
      "that she should be glad to see Sir John Hunter the next day, to explain
      to him a circumstance that had given her, on his account, heartfelt
      uneasiness." Miss Hunter's letter was carefully revised by Mrs. Beaumont,
      though she was to know nothing of it; and such was the art with which it
      was retouched, that, after all proper corrections, nothing appeared but
      the most childish and imprudent simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having despatched these letters, Mrs. Beaumont felt much anxiety
      about the effect which they might produce; but she was doomed by her own
      habits of insincerity to have perpetually the irksome task of assuming an
      appearance contrary to her real feelings. Amelia was better, and Mr.
      Palmer's determination to stay in England had spread a degree of
      cheerfulness over the whole family, which had not been felt for some time
      at Beaumont Park. In this general delight Mrs. Beaumont was compelled
      seemingly to sympathize: she performed her part so well, that even Dr.
      Wheeler and Captain Lightbody, who had been behind the scenes, began to
      believe that the actress was in earnest. Amelia, alas! knew her mother too
      well to be the dupe even of her most consummate powers of acting. All that
      Mrs. Beaumont said about her joy, and her hopes that Captain Walsingham
      would soon appear and confirm her happy <i>pre-sentiments</i>, Amelia
      heard without daring to believe. She had such an opinion of her mother's
      address, such a sublime superstitious dread that her mother would, by some
      inscrutable means, work out her own purposes, that she felt as if she
      could not escape from these secret machinations. Amelia still apprehended
      that Sir John Hunter would not be irrevocably dismissed, and that by some
      turn of artifice she should find herself bound to him. The next morning
      Sir John Hunter, however, finally relieved her from these apprehensions.
      After having been closeted for upwards of two hours with Mrs. Beaumont, he
      begged to speak to Miss Beaumont; and he resigned all pretensions to the
      honour which he had so long and so ardently aspired to. It was his pride
      to show that his spirits were not affected by this disappointment: he
      scarcely indeed exhibited that decent appearance of mortification which is
      usually expected on such an occasion; but with provoking haughtiness
      professed himself sincerely obliged to Miss Beaumont for having, <i>however
      late in the business</i>, prevented him, by her candour, from the danger
      of crossing her inclinations. For this he could scarcely be sufficiently
      thankful, when he considered how every day showed the consequences of
      marrying young ladies whose affections were previously engaged. He had
      only to add, that he hoped the world would see <i>the thing</i> in the
      same light in which he took it, and that Miss Beaumont might not find
      herself blamed for breaking off <i>the matter</i>, after it had been so
      publicly reported: that, for his part, he assured her, he would, as far as
      he was concerned, do his utmost to silence unpleasant observations; and
      that, as the most effectual means to do this, he conceived, would be to
      show that he continued on an amicable footing with the family, he should
      do himself the honour to avail himself of the permission&mdash;invitation,
      indeed&mdash;he had just received from Mrs. Beaumont, to continue his
      visits as usual at Beaumont Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Amelia could make no objection after the express declaration which
      he had just made, that he renounced all pretensions to her favour. However
      keenly she felt the implied reproach of having encouraged Sir John as her
      admirer, while her affections were previously engaged, and of having shown
      candour <i>late</i> in this affair, she could not vindicate herself
      without accusing her mother; therefore she attempted neither excuse nor
      apology, submitted to let the unfeeling baronet enjoy her confusion,
      whilst she said, in general terms, she felt obliged by his assurance that
      she should not be the cause of any quarrel between two families who had
      hitherto lived in friendship.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Him no soft thoughts, no gratitude could move; To gold he fled, from
      beauty and from love!" DRYDEN.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that passed in the two hours' conversation between the discarded
      baronet and the mother of his late mistress did not transpire; but Mrs.
      Beaumont said that she had taken infinite pains to reconcile Sir John to
      his fate, and his subsequent behaviour showed that she had succeeded. His
      attention towards her also plainly proved that he was not dissatisfied by
      the part she had acted, or rather by the part that he thought she had
      acted. Thus all things went on smoothly. Mrs. Beaumont, in confidence,
      told her friend, Miss Hunter, that Sir John had behaved with the greatest
      propriety and candour (candour! that hackneyed word); that he had
      acknowledged that his principal inducement to propose for her daughter had
      been a desire to be connected with a family for which he had such peculiar
      regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This, my love," continued Mrs. Beaumont, "was all, you know, that your
      brother could, with propriety, say on such an occasion; all indeed that I
      would permit him to say. As to the rest, on Amelia's account, you know, I
      could not refuse his request to continue his visits in this family on the
      same footing of friendship as usual."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether this was the truth and the whole truth, the mystery that involves
      all cabinet-councils, and more especially those of female politicians,
      prevents the cautious historian from presuming to decide. But arguing from
      general causes, and from the established characters and ruling passions of
      the parties concerned, we may safely conjecture that the baronet did not
      at this time make any decisive proposal to the lady, but that he kept
      himself at liberty to advance or recede, as circumstances should render it
      expedient. His ruling passion was avarice; and though he had been allured
      by the hints which his sister had thrown out concerning Mrs. Beaumont's
      increased jointure, and vast expectancies from Mr. Palmer, yet he was not
      so rash as to act decisively upon such vague information: he had wisely
      determined to obtain accurate and positive evidence from Captain
      Lightbody, who seemed, in this case, to be the common vouchee; but
      Lightbody happened to be gone out to shoot <i>flappers</i>.<a
      href="#linknote-4" name="linknoteref-4" id="linknoteref-4"><small>4</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently Sir John wisely entrenched himself in general professions of
      regard to Mrs. Beaumont, and reflections on the happiness of being
      connected with such a respectable family. Mrs. Beaumont, who understood
      the whole of the game, now saw that her play must be to take Captain
      Lightbody again into her confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever careful not to commit herself, she employed Miss Hunter to
      communicate <i>her own scheme</i> to the captain, and to prepare him on
      the requisite points with proper answers to those inquiries which she
      foresaw the baronet would make.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know, my love," said Mrs. Beaumont, "you can find a proper moment to
      say all you wish to Lightbody."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes," said Miss Hunter, "I will if I possibly can this day; but it is
      so difficult to find a good time&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At dinner, suppose?" said Mrs. Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At dinner! surely, ma'am, that's an awkward time, is not it, for talking
      of secrets?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best time in the world, my dear; you know we are to have the Duttons,
      and the Lord knows whom besides, to-day. And when there's a large company,
      and every body talking at once, and eating, and drinking, and carving, it
      is the best time in the world! You may say what you please; your
      neighbours are all happily engaged, too busy to mind you. Get near fat Mr.
      Dutton, and behind the screen of his prodigious elbow you will be
      comfortably recessed from curious impertinents. My dear, the most perfect
      solitude is not so convenient as one of these great dinners."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Mrs. Beaumont was demonstrating to Miss Hunter that the most
      convenient and secure time for a <i>tête-à-tête</i> is at a large dinner,
      she happened to look out of the window, near which they were standing, and
      she saw her son and daughter with Mr. Palmer walking in the park; they sat
      down under a tree within view of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come away from the window, my dear," said Mrs. Beaumont; "they will
      observe us, and perhaps think we are plotting something. I wonder what
      they are talking of! Look how earnestly Amelia is stretching out her neck,
      and Mr. Palmer striking his cane upon the ground. Come back a little, my
      dear, come back; you can see as well here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I see a gentleman on horseback, galloping. Oh, ma'am, look! he has
      stopped! he has jumped off his horse! Captain Walsingham it must be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Captain Walsingham it really is!" said Mrs. Beaumont, pressing forward to
      look out of the window, yet standing so, that she could not be seen from
      without.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear," said Miss Hunter, "but how delighted Mr. Beaumont seems; and how
      Mr. Palmer shakes Captain Walsingham's hand, as if he had known him these
      hundred years! What can make them so glad to see him? Do look at them,
      ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see it all!" said Mrs. Beaumont, with an involuntary sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, dear Mrs. Beaumont," pursued Miss Hunter, "if he has actually come
      at last to propose for Amelia, don't you think he is doing it in a shabby
      sort of way? When he has been in London too&mdash;and if he has taken such
      a treasure too, could not he have come down here a little more in style,
      with some sort of an equipage of his own at least? But now only look at
      him; would you, if you met him on the road, know him from any common man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Another sigh, deep and sincere, was all the answer Mrs. Beaumont made.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure," continued Miss Hunter, as Mrs. Beaumont drew her away from
      the window, "I am sure, I think Amelia has not gained much by the change
      of admirers; for what's a captain of a ship?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He ranks with a colonel in the army, to be sure," said Mrs. Beaumont;
      "but Amelia might have looked much higher. If she does not know her own
      interest and dignity, that is not my fault."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she had such a fortune as I shall have," said Miss Hunter, "she might
      afford to marry for love, because you know she could make her husband
      afterwards keep her proper equipages, and take her to town, and go into
      parliament, and get a title for her too!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true, my darling," said Mrs. Beaumont, who was at this instant so
      absent, that she assented without having heard one syllable that her
      darling said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But for Amelia, who has no such great fortune of her own, it is quite
      another thing, you know, dearest Mrs. Beaumont. Oh, you'll see how she'll
      repent when she sees you Lady Puckeridge, and herself plain Mrs.
      Walsingham. And when she sees the figure you'll make in town next winter,
      and the style my brother will live in&mdash;Oh, then she'll see what a
      difference there is between Sir John Hunter and Captain Walsingham!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true, indeed, my dear," said Mrs. Beaumont; and this time she did
      not answer without having heard the assertion. The door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Captain Walsingham! dare I believe my eyes? And do I see our friend,
      Captain Walsingham, again at last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At last! Oh, Mrs. Beaumont, you don't know how hard I have worked to get
      here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How kind! But won't you sit down and tell me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I can neither sit, nor rest, nor speak, nor think upon any subject
      but one," said Captain Walsingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right," cried Mr. Palmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Beaumont&mdash;pardon my abruptness," continued Captain Walsingham,
      "but you see before you a man whose whole happiness is at stake. May I beg
      a few minutes' conversation with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This instant," said Mrs. Beaumont, hesitating; but she saw that Mr.
      Palmer's eye was upon her, so with a smile she complied immediately; and
      giving her hand graciously to Captain Walsingham, she accompanied him into
      a little reading-room within the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I hope that we are friends?" said Captain Walsingham; "may I hope so,
      Mrs. Beaumont&mdash;may I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens! Friends! assuredly; I hope so. I have always had and
      expressed the highest opinion of you, Captain Walsingham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have had one, and, hitherto, but one opportunity of showing myself, in
      any degree, deserving of your esteem, madam," said Captain Walsingham.
      "When I was in this country some years ago, you must have seen how
      passionately I was in love with your daughter; but I knew that my
      circumstances were then such that I could not hope to obtain Miss
      Beaumont's hand; and you will do me the justice to allow that I behaved
      with prudence. Of the difficulty of the task I alone can judge."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont declared, that she admired Captain Walsingham's conduct
      inexpressibly, now that she understood what his feelings and motives had
      been; but really he had kept his own secret so honourably, that she had
      not, till within these few days, when it was <i>let out</i> by Mr.
      Walsingham to Mr. Palmer, had the most distant idea of his being attached
      to her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Walsingham was too polite even to <i>look</i> a doubt of the truth
      of a lady's assertion: he therefore believed, because it was impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont, determining to make her story consistent, repeated nearly
      what she had said to Mr. Palmer, and went on to confess that she had
      often, with a mother's pride, perhaps, in her own secret thoughts wondered
      at the indifference Captain Walsingham showed towards Amelia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Walsingham was surprised that Mrs. Beaumont's penetration should
      have been so strangely mistaken; especially as the symptoms of admiration
      and love must be so well known to a lady who had so many and such
      passionate admirers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont smiled, and observed, that Captain Walsingham, though a
      seaman, had all the address of a courtier, and she acknowledged that she
      loved address.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If by address Mrs. Beaumont means politeness, I admire it as much as she
      does; but I disclaim and despise all that paltry system of artifice, which
      is sometimes called address. No person of a great mind ever condescends to
      use <i>address</i> in that sense of the word; not because they cannot, but
      because they will not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly&mdash;certainly," said Mrs. Beaumont; "there is nothing I love
      so much as frankness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, frankly, Mrs. Beaumont, may I hope for your approbation in
      addressing Miss Beaumont?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frankly, then, you have my full approbation. This is the very thing I
      have long secretly wished, as Mr. Palmer can tell you. You have ever been
      the son-in-law of my choice, though not of my hopes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Delighted with this frank answer, this full approbation, this assurance
      that he had always been the son-in-law of her choice, Captain Walsingham
      poured out his warm heart in joy and gratitude. All suspicions of Mrs.
      Beaumont were forgotten; for suspicion was unnatural to his mind: though
      he knew, though he had experience almost from childhood, of her character,
      yet, at this instant, he thought he had, till now, been always prejudiced,
      always mistaken. Happy those who can be thus duped by the warmth of their
      own hearts! It is a happiness which they who smile in scorn at their
      credulity can never enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wakening a little to the use of his understanding, Captain Walsingham
      disconcerted Mrs. Beaumont, by suddenly saying, "Then there was not any
      truth in the report, which I have heard with horror, that you were going
      to marry Miss Beaumont to Sir John Hunter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then there was not any truth in the report I heard with horror, that you
      were going to marry yourself to a Spanish nun?" said Mrs. Beaumont, who
      had learned from a veteran in public warfare, that the best way to parry
      an attack is not to defend, but to make an assault.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Captain Walsingham," added she, with an arch smile, "I really
      thought you were a man of too much sense, and above all, too much courage,
      to be terror-struck by every idle report. You should leave such <i>horrors</i>
      to us weak women&mdash;to the visionary mind. Now, I could not blame poor
      Amelia, if she were to ask, 'Then was there no truth in the report of the
      Spanish incognita?'&mdash;No, no," pursued Mrs. Beaumont, playfully, refusing
      to hear Captain Walsingham; "not to me, not to <i>me</i>, must your
      defence be made. Appear before your judge, appear before Amelia; I can
      only recommend you to mercy."
    </p>
    <p>
      What a charming woman this Mrs. Beaumont would be, if one could feel quite
      sure of her sincerity, thought Captain Walsingham, as he followed the
      lady, who, with apparently playful, but really polite grace, thus eluded
      all further inquiry into her secret manoeuvres.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, my dearest Amelia," cried she, "is a culprit, whom I am bringing to
      your august tribunal for mercy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For justice," said Captain Walsingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Justice! Oh, the pride of the man's heart, and the folly! Who ever talks
      of justice to a woman? My dear captain, talk of mercy, or cruelty, if you
      will; we ladies delight in being called cruel, you know, and sometimes are
      even pleased to be merciful&mdash;but to be just, is the last thing we
      think of: so now for your trial; public or private, Captain Walsingham?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Public! as I am innocent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oyes, oyes! all manner of men," cried Mr. Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Spanish cause coming on!" cried Mr. Palmer: "let me hear it; and let
      me have a good seat that I may hear&mdash;a seat near the judge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you shall be judge, Mr. Palmer," said Amelia; "and here is the best
      seat for our good judge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you will remember," said Mr. Beaumont, "that it is the duty of a good
      judge to lean towards the prisoner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To lean! No, to sit bolt upright, as I will if I can," said old Mr.
      Palmer, entering into the pleasantry of the young people as readily as if
      he had been the youngest man in the company. As he looked round, his good
      countenance beamed with benevolent pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, sir captain, be pleased to inform the court what you have done, or
      mean to do, with a certain Spanish nun, whom, as it is confidently
      asserted in a letter from one of your own men, you carried off from her
      nunnery, and did bring, or cause to be brought, with you to England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord judge, will you do me the favour, or the justice, to order that
      the letter alluded to may be read in court?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was ordered, and done accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord judge," said Captain Walsingham, "I have nothing to object to the
      truth of the main points of this story; and considering that it was told
      by a very young man, and a traveller, it contains but a reasonable share
      of <i>'travellers' wonders.'</i> Considering the opportunity and
      temptation for embellishments afforded by such a romantic tale, less has
      been added to it by the narrator than the usual progress of strange
      reports might have prepared me to expect. It is most true, as it has been
      stated, that I did, by her own desire, carry away from a nunnery, at
      &mdash;&mdash;, this lady, who was neither a nun nor a Spanish lady, nor,
      as I am compelled by my regard to truth to add, young, nor yet handsome.
      My lord judge, far be it from me to impeach the veracity of the
      letter-writer. It is admitted by the highest and the lowest authorities,
      that beauty is a matter of taste, and that for taste there is no standard;
      it is also notorious, that to a sailor every woman is fair and young, who
      is not as old as Hecuba, or as ugly as Caifacaratadaddera. I can therefore
      speak only to my own opinion and judgment. And really, my lord, it grieves
      me much to spoil the romance, to destroy the effect of a tale, which might
      in future serve for the foundation of some novel, over which belles and
      beaux, yet unborn, might weep and wonder: it grieves me much, I say, to be
      compelled by the severity of this cross-examination to declare the simple
      truth, that there was no love in the case; that, to the very best of my
      belief and judgment, the lady was not in love with any body, much less
      with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you have admitted, sir," said the judge, "as you have voluntarily
      stated, that to a sailor every woman is fair and young, who is not as old
      as Hecuba, or as ugly as that other woman with the unspeakable name, you
      will be pleased to inform the court how it happened, or how it was
      possible, that in the course of a long voyage, you could avoid falling in
      love with the damsel whom you had thus rescued and carried off. Experience
      shows us, sir, that at land, and, I presume, at sea, proximity is one of
      the most common causes of love. Now, I understand, she was the only woman
      you saw for some months; and she had, I think you allow, possession of
      your cabin, to and from which you had of course constant egress and
      regress. Sir, human nature is human nature; here is temptation, and
      opportunity, and circumstantial evidence enough, in our days, to hang a
      man. What have you to offer in your defence, young man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The plain fact, my lord, is, that instead of three months, I was but
      three days in the dangerous state of proximity with the Spanish lady. But
      had it been three months, or three years, there is my defence, my lord,"
      said Captain Walsingham, bowing to Amelia. "At the first <i>blush</i>, you
      allow it, I see, to be powerful; but how powerful, you cannot feel as I
      do, without having looked, as I have done, into the mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have looked into the mind as well as you, sir. You have a great deal of
      assurance, to tell me I cannot feel and judge as well as you can. But,
      nevertheless, I shall do you justice. I think your defence is sufficient.
      I believe we must acquit him. But, pray&mdash;the plain matter of fact,
      which I wanted to hear, I have not yet got at. What have you done with
      this lady? and where is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was carried safely to her friends&mdash;to her friend, for she has
      but one friend, that I could find out, an old aunt, who lives in an
      obscure lodging, in a narrow street, in London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, upon honour, this is all you know about her?" said Mrs. Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All&mdash;except that she is in hopes of recovering some property, of
      which she says she has been unjustly defrauded by some of her relations.
      After I had paid my respects at the Admiralty, I made it my business to
      see the lady, and to offer my services; but into her lawsuits, I thank
      God, it was not my business to inquire, I recommended to her a good honest
      lawyer, and came here as fast as horses could carry me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But was not there some giving of diamonds, and exchanging of rings, one
      day, upon deck?" said Mrs. Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "None," said Captain Walsingham; "that was a mere fable of poor Birch's
      imagination. I recollect the lady showed me a Spanish motto upon her ring;
      that is all I can remember about rings.&mdash;She had no diamonds, and
      very few clothes. Now," cried Captain Walsingham, growing a little
      impatient of the length of his trial, for he had not yet been able to
      speak for more than an instant to Amelia, "now, I hope, my trial is ended;
      else its length will be, as in some other cases, the worst of
      punishments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Acquitted! acquitted! honourably acquitted!" said Mr. Palmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Acquitted, acquitted, honourably acquitted by general acclamation," cried
      Mr. Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Acquitted by a smile from Amelia, worth all our acclamations," said Mrs.
      Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Captain Walsingham," said Miss Hunter, "did the lady come to England and
      go to London in a Spanish dress and long waist?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke, but Captain Walsingham did not hear her important question. She
      turned to repeat it, but the captain was gone, and Amelia with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless me! how quick! how odd!" said Miss Hunter, with a pouting look,
      which seemed to add&mdash;nobody carries me off!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaumont looked duller than was becoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont applied herself to adjust the pretty curls of Miss Hunter's
      hair; and Mr. Palmer, in one of his absent fits, hummed aloud, as he
      walked up and down the room,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "'And it's, Oh! what will become of me?
     Oh! what shall I do?
     Nobody coming to marry me,
     Nobody coming to woo.'"

      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "True love's the gift which God has giv'n To man alone, beneath the
      heav'n; It is the secret sympathy, The silver link, the silken tie, Which
      heart to heart, and mind to mind, In body and in soul can bind."
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy love, though the most delightful in reality, is the most
      uninteresting in description; and lovers are proverbially bad company,
      except for one another: therefore we shall not intrude on Captain
      Walsingham and Amelia, nor shall we give a journal of the days of
      courtship; those days which, by Rousseau, and many people, have been
      pronounced to be the happiest; by others, the only happy days of
      existence; and which, by some privileged or prudent few, have been found
      to be but the prelude to the increasing pleasures of domestic union.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that Mr. Beaumont saw his sister and his friend thus gratified in
      their mutual esteem and affection,&mdash;now that he saw all obstacles to
      their union removed, he became uncontroulably impatient to declare his own
      attachment to Miss Walsingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear mother, I can bear it no longer. Believe me, you are mistaken in
      the whole romance you have imagined to yourself about Miss Hunter. She is
      no more in love with me than I am with her. Since you fixed my attention
      upon her, I have studied the young lady. She is not capable of love: I
      don't mean that she is not capable of wishing to be married, but that is
      quite a different affair, which need not give me any peculiar disturbance.
      My dear mother, find another husband for her, and my life for it, her
      heart will not break; especially if you give her bales of wedding finery
      enough to think and talk about for a calendar year.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You abominably malicious monster of cruelty, I will not smile, nor will I
      allow you to indulge your humour in this manner at the expense of your
      poor victim."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Victim! never saw a girl look less like a victim, except, indeed, as to
      her ornaments. I believe it is the etiquette for victims to appear dressed
      out with garlands, and ribands, and flowers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Positively, Edward, I won't allow you to go on in this style;&mdash;do
      you know you seriously hurt and offend me? do you consider that Miss
      Hunter's mother was my most intimate friend, and this match I have
      anxiously wished, in consequence of an agreement made between us at your
      birth and Albina's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, ma'am, those agreements never turned out well, from the time of the
      Arabian tales to the present moment. And you must pardon me if, after
      having tried all that reason and patience would do, in vain, I now come to
      impatience, and a little innocent ridicule. Except by laughing, I have no
      other way left of convincing you that I never can or will marry this young
      lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But so pretty a creature! Surely you <i>have thought</i> her pretty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Extremely pretty. And I acknowledge that there have been moments when the
      influence of her&mdash;beauty, I can't call it&mdash;prettiness, joined to
      the power of my mother's irresistible address, have almost lapped me in
      elysium&mdash;a fool's paradise. But, thank Heaven and Miss Walsingham! I
      unlapped myself; and though the sweet airs took my fancy, they never
      imprisoned my soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vastly poetical! quite in the blue-stocking style."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blue-stocking! Dear mother, that expression is not elegant enough for
      you. That commonplace taunt is unworthy of my mother," said Mr. Beaumont,
      warmly, for he was thrown off his guard by the reflection implied on Miss
      Walsingham. "Ignorant silly women may be allowed to sneer at information
      and talents in their own sex, and, if they have read them, may talk of <i>'Les
      Précieuses Ridicules</i>,' and <i>'Les Femmes Savantes</i>,' and may
      borrow from Molière all the wit they want, to support the cause of folly.
      But from women who are themselves distinguished for talents, such apostasy&mdash;but
      I am speaking to my mother&mdash;I forbear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great forbearance to your mother you have shown, in truth," cried Mrs.
      Beaumont, reddening with genuine anger: "Marry as you please! I have done.
      Fool that I have been, to devote my life to plans for the happiness and
      aggrandizement of my children! It is now time I should think of myself.
      You shall not see me the defeated, deserted, duped, despised mother&mdash;the
      old dowager <i>permitted</i> in the house of which she was once the
      mistress! No, no, Mr. Beaumont," cried she, rising indignantly, "this
      shall never, never be."
    </p>
    <p>
      Touched and astonished by a burst of passion, such as he scarcely had ever
      before seen from his mother, Mr. Beaumont stopped her as she rose; and
      taking her hand in the most affectionate manner, "Forgive me, my dear
      mother, the hasty words I said just now. I was very much in the wrong. I
      beg your pardon. Forgive your son."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont struggled to withdraw the hand which her son forcibly
      detained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be always," continued he, "be always mistress of this house, of me, and
      mine. The chosen wife of my heart will never torment you, or degrade
      herself, with paltry struggles for power. Your days shall be happy and
      honoured: believe me, I speak from my heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont looked as if her anger had subsided; yet, as if struggling
      with unusual feelings, she sat silent. Mr. Beaumont continued, "Your son&mdash;who
      is no sentimentalist, no speech-maker&mdash;your son, who has hitherto
      perhaps been too rough, too harsh&mdash;now implores you, by these sincere
      caresses, by all that is tender and true in nature, to believe in the
      filial affection of your children. Give us, simply give us your
      confidence; and our confidence, free and unconstrained, shall be given in
      return. Then we shall be happy indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Touched, vanquished, Mrs. Beaumont leaned her head on her son, and said,
      "Then we shall be happy indeed!" The exclamation was sincere: at this
      moment she thought as she spoke. All her schemes were forgotten: the
      reversionary title, the Wigram estate&mdash;all, all forgotten: miraculous
      eloquence and power of truth!
    </p>
    <p>
      "What happiness!" said Mrs. Beaumont: "I ask no other. You are right, my
      dear son; marry Miss Walsingham, and we have enough, and more than enough,
      for happiness. You are right; and henceforward we shall have but one mind
      amongst us."
    </p>
    <p>
      With true gratitude and joy her son embraced her; and this was the most
      delightful, perhaps the only really delightful, moment she had felt for
      years. She was sincere, and at ease. But this touch of nature, strong as
      it was, operated only for a moment: habit resumed her influence; art
      regained her pupil and her slave! Captain Lightbody and Miss Hunter came
      into the room; and with them came low thoughts of plots, and notes, and
      baronets, and equipages, and a reversionary title, and the Wigram estate.
      What different ideas of happiness! Her son, in the mean time, had started
      up, mounted his horse, and had galloped off to realize some of his ideas
      of felicity, by the immediate offer of his hand to the lady who possessed
      his whole heart. Cool as policy, just recovered from the danger of
      imprudent sensibility, could make her, Mrs. Beaumont was now all herself
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you found much amusement shooting this morning, Lightbody?" said
      she, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, ma'am; done nothing&mdash;just nothing at all&mdash;for I met Sir
      John in the grounds, and could not leave him. Poor Sir John, ma'am; I tell
      him we must get him a crook; he is quite turned despairing shepherd. Never
      saw a man so changed. Upon my soul, he is&mdash;seriously now, Mrs.
      Beaumont, you need not laugh&mdash;I always told Sir John that his time of
      falling in love would come; and come it has, at last, with a vengeance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nonsense! nonsense, Lightbody! This to me! and of Sir John Hunter!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Mrs. Beaumont called it, and thought it nonsense, yet it flattered
      her; and though she appeared half offended by flattery so gross, as to
      seem almost an insult upon her understanding, yet her vanity was secretly
      gratified, even by feeling that she had dependents who were thus obliged
      to flatter; and though she despised Captain Lightbody for the meanness,
      yet he made his court to her successfully, by persisting in all the
      audacity of adulation. She knew Sir John Hunter too well to believe that
      he was liable to fall in love with any thing but a fair estate or a fine
      fortune; yet she was gratified by feeling that she possessed so great a
      share of those charms which age cannot wither; of that substantial power,
      to which men do not merely feign in poetical sport to submit, or to which
      they are slaves only for a honey-moon, but to which they do homage to the
      latest hour of life, with unabating, with increasing devotion. Besides
      this sense of pleasure arising from calculation, it may be presumed that,
      like all other female politicians, our heroine had something of the woman
      lurking at her heart; something of that feminine vanity, which inclines to
      believe in the potency of personal charms, even when they are in the wane.
      Captain Lightbody's asseverations, and the notes Sir John Hunter wrote to
      his sister, were at last listened to by Mrs. Beaumont with patience, and
      even with smiles; and, after it had been sufficiently reiterated, that
      really it was using Sir John Hunter ill not to give him some more decisive
      answer, when he was so unhappy, so impatient, she at length exclaimed,
      "Well, Lightbody, tell your friend Sir John, then, since it must be so, I
      will consult my friends, and see what can be done for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When may I say? for I dare not see Sir John again&mdash;positively I dare
      not meet him&mdash;without having some hope to give, something decisive.
      He says the next time he comes here he must be allowed to make it known to
      the family that he is Mrs. Beaumont's admirer. So, when may I say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dearest Mrs. Beaumont," cried Miss Hunter, "say to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow! impossible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But when?" said Miss Hunter: "only look at my brother's note to me again;
      you see he is afraid of being cast off at last as he was before about
      Amelia, if Mr. Palmer should object; and he says this disappointment would
      be such a very different affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed," said Captain Lightbody, "I, who am in Sir John's confidence, can
      vouch for that; for I have reason to believe, that&mdash;that <i>the
      connexion</i> was the charm, and that the daughter would not have been
      thought of. Stop, I was charged not to say this. But <i>when</i> Mrs.
      Beaumont, to return to my point&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! name an early day," cried Miss Hunter, in a fondling tone; "name an
      early day for my brother's coming; and then, you know, it will be so <i>nice</i>
      to have the wedding days fixed for both marriages. And, dearest Mrs.
      Beaumont, remember I am to be your bride's-maid; and we'll have a
      magnificent wedding, and I shall be bride's-maid!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The dear innocent little creature, how mad she is with spirits! Well, you
      shall be my bride's-maid, if the thing takes place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>If.&mdash;If</i> to the winds!&mdash;Captain Lightbody, tell my
      brother&mdash;No, I'll write myself, and tell him he may come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How she distresses me! But she is so affectionate, one does not know how
      to be angry with her. But, my dear, as to naming the day when he may
      publicly declare himself, I cannot; for, you know, I have to break the
      affair to Mr. Palmer, and to my son and daughter, and I must take my own
      time, and find a happy moment for this; so name a day I cannot; but in
      general&mdash;and it's always safest to use general terms&mdash;you may
      say, <i>soon</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Mrs. Beaumont's ultimatum. The note was written accordingly, and
      committed to the care of the confidential captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      This business of mysterious note-writing, and secret negotiations<a
      href="#linknote-5" name="linknoteref-5" id="linknoteref-5"><small>5</small></a>,
      was peculiarly suited to our heroine's genius and taste. Considering the
      negotiation to be now in effect brought within view of a happy
      termination, her ambassador, furnished with her ultimatum, having now
      actually set out on his ostensible mission of duck-shooting, our fair
      negotiatrix prepared to show the usual degree of gratitude towards those
      who had been the principal instruments of her success. The proper time,
      she thought, was now arrived, when, having no further occasion for Miss
      Hunter's services, she might finally undeceive her young friend as to any
      hopes she might retain of a union with Mr. Beaumont; and she felt that it
      was now indispensably necessary to disclose the truth, that her son had
      declared his attachment to Miss Walsingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont opened the delicate case with a sigh, which claimed the
      notice of her young confidante.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a deep sigh!" said Miss Hunter, who was perfect, to use a musical
      term, in her lessons, <i>pour observer les soupirs</i>: "What a sigh! I
      hope it was for my poor brother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, no, my love! for one nearer my heart&mdash;for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For me!&mdash;dear me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see before you a mother, all of whose fondest wishes and plans are
      doomed to be frustrated by her children. Amelia would have her way: I was
      forced to yield. My son follows her example, insists upon marrying without
      fortune, or extraordinary beauty, or any of the advantages which I had
      fondly pointed out in the daughter-in-law of my heart. You turn away from
      me, my darling! How shall I go on? how shall I tell you all the terrible
      truth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, ma'am, pray go on; pray tell me all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Walsingham; that's all, in one word. These Walsinghams have forced
      themselves into my family,&mdash;fairly outwitted me. I cannot tell you
      how much, how deeply I am mortified!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank Heaven! I am not mortified," cried Miss Hunter, throwing back her
      head with pettish disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont, who had prepared herself for a fainting fit, or at least
      for a flood of tears, rejoiced to see this turn in the young lady's
      temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right, my own love. Hew I admire your spirit! This pride becomes
      you, and is what I expected from your understanding. Set a just value upon
      yourself, and show it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should set but little value on myself, indeed, if I did not think
      myself equal to Miss Walsingham; but Mr. Beaumont knows best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not best, I fear," said Mrs. Beaumont; "but, from a child he was ever the
      most self-willed, uncontrollable being; there was no moving, no persuading
      him. There was no power, no appeal, my love, I did not try."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear ma'am, I am excessively sorry you did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, my dear, I could not refrain from doing all I could, not only for my
      son's sake, but for yours, when I saw your affections, as I feared, so
      deeply engaged. But your present magnanimity gives me hopes that the shock
      will not be irrecoverable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Irrecoverable! No, really, ma'am. If Mr. Beaumont expects to see me wear
      the willow for him all my life, his vanity will be mistaken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, my dear," replied Mrs. Beaumont, "you would not be so weak as
      to wear the willow for any man. A young lady of your fortune should never
      wear the weeping but the golden willow. Turn your pretty little face again
      towards me, and smile once more upon me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hunter had sat with her face turned from Mrs. Beaumont during the
      whole of this dialogue&mdash;"as if by hiding her face, she could conceal
      the emotions of her mind from me," thought her penetrating observer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spare me, spare me, dearest Mrs. Beaumont," cried Miss Hunter, hiding her
      face on the arm of the sofa, and seeming now disposed to pass from the
      heights of anger to the depths of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont, less hard-hearted than some politicians, who care not who
      dies or lives, provided they attain their own objects, now listened at
      least with seeming commiseration to her young friend, who, with
      intermitting sighs, and in a voice which her position or her sobs rendered
      scarcely audible, talked of dying, and of never marrying any other man
      upon the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not much alarmed, however, by the dying words of young ladies, Mrs.
      Beaumont confined her attention to the absurdity of the resolution against
      marriage in general, and at this instant formed a plan of marrying Miss
      Hunter to one of her nephews instead of her son. She had one unmarried
      nephew, a young man of good figure and agreeable manners, but with only a
      younger brother's portion. To him she thought Miss Hunter's large fortune
      would be highly convenient; and she had reason to believe that his taste
      in the choice of a wife would be easily governed by her advice, or by his
      interest. Thus she could, at least, prevent her young friend's affections
      and fortune from going out of the family. In consequence of this glimpse
      of a new scheme, our indefatigable politician applied herself to prepare
      the way for it with her wonted skill. She soothed the lovelorn and pettish
      damsel with every expression that could gratify pride and rouse high
      thoughts of revenge. She suggested that instead of making rash vows of
      celibacy, which would only show forlorn constancy, Miss Hunter should
      abide by her first spirited declaration, never to wear the willow for any
      man; and that the best way to assert her own dignity would be to marry as
      soon as possible. After having given this consolatory advice, Mrs.
      Beaumont left the young lady's grief to wear itself out. "I know, my
      love," added she, "a friend of mine who would die for the happiness which
      my obstinate son does not, it seems, know how to value."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, ma'am?" said Miss Hunter, raising her head: "I'm sure I can't guess
      whom you can possibly mean&mdash;who, ma'am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! my dear, excuse me," said Mrs. Beaumont, "that is a secret I cannot
      tell you yet. When you are 'fit to hear yourself convinced,' may be, I may
      obtain leave to tell you your admirer's name. I can assure you, he's a
      very fashionable and a very agreeable man; a great favourite with our sex,
      a particular friend of mine, and an officer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord bless me!" exclaimed Miss Hunter, starting quite up, "an officer! I
      can't imagine whom you mean! Dear Mrs. Beaumont, whom can you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont walked towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only tell me one thing, dearest Mrs. Beaumont&mdash;did I ever see him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont, wisely declining to answer any more questions at present,
      quitted the room, and left Miss Hunter dying&mdash;with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new delight of this fresh project, with the prospect of bringing to a
      happy termination her negotiation with Sir John Hunter, sustained Mrs.
      Beaumont's spirits in the midst of the disappointments she experienced
      respecting the marriages of her son and daughter; and enabled her, with
      less effort of dissimulation, to take apparently a share in the general
      joy which now pervaded her family. Her son expressed his felicity with
      unbounded rapture, when he found his proposal to Miss Walsingham
      graciously received by the object of his affections, and by all her
      family: his gratitude to his mother for no longer opposing his wishes gave
      a tenderness to his manner which would have touched any heart but that of
      a politician. Amelia, also, even in the midst of her love for Captain
      Walsingham, was anxiously intent upon showing dutiful attention to her
      mother, and upon making her some amends for the pain she had caused her of
      late. Whenever the brother and sister were together, in all their views of
      future happiness their mother was one of their principal objects; and
      these dispositions both Miss Walsingham and Captain Walsingham were
      earnest to confirm. No young people could have higher ideas than they had
      of the duty of children towards parents, and of the delight of family
      confidence and union. In former times, when Mr. Beaumont had been somewhat
      to blame in the roughness of his sincerity towards his mother, and when he
      had been disposed to break from her artful restraints, Captain Walsingham,
      by his conversation, and by his letters, had always used his power and
      influence to keep him within bounds; and whenever he could do so with
      truth, to raise Mrs. Beaumont in his opinion. She now appeared in a more
      advantageous light to her family, and they were more disposed to believe
      in her sincerity than they had ever been since the credulous days of
      childhood. The days of love and childhood are perhaps, in good minds,
      almost equally credulous, or, at least, confiding. Even Mr. Walsingham was
      won over by the pleasure he felt in the prospect of his daughter's
      happiness; and good Mr. Palmer was ten times more attentive than ever to
      Madam Beaumont. In his attention, however, there was something more
      ceremonious than formerly; it was evident, for he was too honest to
      conceal his feelings, that his opinion of her was changed, and that his
      attention was paid to her rather as the widow of his old friend than on
      her own account. Amelia, who particularly remarked this change, and who
      feared that it must be severely painful to her mother, tried by every
      honest art of kindness to reinstate her in his regard. Amelia, however,
      succeeded only in raising herself in his esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not disturb yourself, my dear young lady," said he to her, one day,
      "about your mother and me. Things are on their right footing between us,
      and can never be on any other. She, you see, is quite satisfied."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont, indeed, had not Amelia's quick sensibility with regard to
      the real affections of her friends, though she was awake to every external
      mark of attention. She was content, as Mr. Palmer before others always
      treated her with marked deference, and gave her no reason to apprehend any
      alteration in his testamentary dispositions. When settlements were talked
      of for the intended marriages, Mr. Palmer seemed to consider Mrs. Beaumont
      first in all their consultations, appealed for her opinion, and had ever a
      most cautious eye upon her interests. This she observed with satisfaction,
      and she was gratified by the demonstrations of increased regard from her
      son and daughter, because she thought it would facilitate her projects.
      She wished that her marriage with Sir John Hunter should appear well to
      the world; and for this reason she desired that it should <i>seem</i> to
      be liked by all her family&mdash;seem, for as to their real opinions she
      was indifferent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things were in this situation, when Mrs. Beaumont <i>caused herself to be
      surprised</i><a href="#linknote-6" name="linknoteref-6" id="linknoteref-6"><small>6</small></a>
      one morning by Mr. Palmer, with a letter in her hand, deep in reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! my dear Mr. Palmer, is it you?" cried she, starting very naturally;
      "I was really so lost in thought&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Palmer hoped that he did not disturb her.&mdash;"Disturb me! no, my
      good friend, you are the very person I wished to consult." Her eye glanced
      again and again upon the letter she held in her hand, but Mr. Palmer
      seemed provokingly destitute of curiosity; he however took a chair, and
      his snuff-box, and with a polite but cold manner said he was much honoured
      by her consulting him, but that of course his judgment could be of little
      service to a lady of Mrs. Beaumont's understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Understanding! Ah!" said she, "there are cases where understanding is of
      no use to women, but quite the contrary."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Palmer did not contradict the assertion, nor did he assent to it, but
      waited, with a pinch of snuff arrested in its way, to have the cases
      specified.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In love affairs, for instance, we poor women," said Mrs. Beaumont,
      looking down prettily; but Mr. Palmer afforded no assistance to her
      bashful hesitation; she was under the necessity of finishing her sentence,
      or of beginning another, upon a different construction. The latter was
      most convenient, and she took a new and franker tone:&mdash;"Here's a
      letter from poor Sir John Hunter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Palmer still sat bending forward to listen with the most composed
      deference, but pressed not in the slightest degree upon her confidence by
      any question or look down towards the letter, or up towards the lady's
      face, but straightforward looked he, till, quite provoked by his dulness,
      Mrs. Beaumont took the matter up again, and, in a new tone, said, "To be
      candid with you, my dear friend, this is a subject on which I feel some
      awkwardness and reluctance in speaking to you&mdash;for of all men
      breathing, I should in any important action of my life wish for your
      approbation; and yet, on the present occasion, I fear, and so does Sir
      John, that you will utterly disapprove of the match."
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused again, to be asked&mdash;What match? But compelled by her
      auditor's invincible silence to make out her own case, she proceeded: "You
      must know, my good sir, that Sir John Hunter is, it seems, unconquerably
      bent upon a connexion with this family; for being refused by the daughter,
      he has proposed for the mother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Mr. Palmer, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you would have been more surprised," said Mrs. Beaumont: "I am
      glad the first sound of the thing does not, as I was afraid it would,
      startle or revolt you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Startle me, it could not, madam," said Mr. Palmer, "for I have been
      prepared for it some time past."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible? And who could have mentioned it to you&mdash;Captain
      Lightbody?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Captain Lightbody!" cried Mr. Palmer, with a sudden flash of indignation:
      "believe me, madam, I never thought of speaking to Captain Lightbody of
      your affairs, I am not in the habit of listening to such people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But still, he might have spoken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, madam, no; he would not have dared to bring me secret information."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Honourable! quite honourable! But then, my dear sir, how came you to know
      the thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw it. You know, madam, those who stand by always see more than the
      players."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you think my son and daughter, and Captain Walsingham, know it
      too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fancy not; for they have not been standers by: they have been deeply
      engaged themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's well&mdash;for I wished to have your opinion and advice in the
      first place, before I hinted it even to them, or any one else living. As I
      feared the match would not meet your approbation, I told Sir John so, and
      I gave him only a provisional consent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like the provisional consent of that young Irish lady," said Mr. Palmer,
      laughing, "who went through the marriage service with her lover, adding at
      the end of each response, 'provided my father gives his consent.'<a
      href="#linknote-7" name="linknoteref-7" id="linknoteref-7"><small>7</small></a>
      But, madam, though I am old enough certainly to be your father, yet even
      if I had the honour to be so in reality, as you are arrived at years of
      discretion, you know you cannot need my consent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But seriously, my excellent friend," cried she, "I never could be happy
      in marrying against your approbation. And let me, in my own vindication,
      explain to you the whole of the affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Palmer, dreading one of her long explanations, which he knew he
      should never comprehend, besought her not to invest him with the
      unbecoming character of her judge. He represented that no vindication was
      necessary, and that none could be of any use. She however persisted in
      going through a sentimental defence of her conduct. She assured Mr.
      Palmer, that she had determined never to marry again; that her inviolable
      respect for her dear Colonel Beaumont's memory had induced her to persist
      in this resolution for many years. That motives of delicacy and generosity
      were what first prevailed with her to listen to Sir John's suit; and that
      now she consoled and supported herself by the proud reflection, that she
      was acting as her dear Colonel Beaumont himself, could he know the
      circumstances and read her heart, would wish and enjoin her to act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a smile seemed to play upon Mr. Palmer's countenance; but the smile
      had vanished in an instant, and was followed by a sudden gush of tears,
      which were as suddenly wiped away; not, however, before they reminded Mrs.
      Beaumont to spread her handkerchief before her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," resumed she, after a decent pause, "perhaps I am doing wrong
      with the best intentions. Some people think that widows should never, on
      any account, marry again, and perhaps Mr. Palmer is of this opinion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, by no means," said Mr. Palmer; "nor was Colonel Beaumont. Often and
      often he said in his letters to me, that he wished his wife to marry again
      after he was gone, and to be as happy after his death as she had been
      during his life. I only hope that your choice may fulfil&mdash;may justify&mdash;"
      Mr. Palmer stopped again, something in Shakspeare, about preying on
      garbage, ran in his head; and, when Mrs. Beaumont went on to some fresh
      topics of vindication, and earnestly pressed for his <i>advice</i>, he
      broke up the conference by exclaiming, "'Fore Jupiter, madam, we had
      better say nothing more about the matter; for, after all, what can the wit
      of man or woman make of it, but that you choose to marry Sir John Hunter,
      and that nobody in the world has a right to object to it? There is
      certainly no occasion to use any management with me; and your eloquence is
      only wasting itself, for I am not so presumptuous, or so unreasonable, as
      to set myself up for the judge of your actions. You do me honour by
      consulting me; but as you already know my opinion of the gentleman, I must
      decline saying any thing further on the subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont was left in a painful state of doubt as to the main point,
      whether Mr. Palmer would or would not alter his will. However, as she was
      determined that the match should be accomplished, she took advantage of
      the declaration Mr. Palmer made, that he had no right to object to her
      following her own inclinations; and she told Sir John Hunter that Mr.
      Palmer was perfectly satisfied; and that he had indeed relieved her mind
      from some foolish scruples, by having assured her that it was Colonel
      Beaumont's particular wish, often expressed in his confidential letters,
      that his widow should marry again. So far, so good. Then the affair was to
      be broken to her son and daughter. She begged Mr. Palmer would undertake,
      for her sake, this delicate task; but he declined it with a frank
      simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely, madam," said he, "you can speak without difficulty to your own
      son and daughter; and I have through life observed, that employing one
      person to speak to another is almost always hurtful. I should not presume,
      however, to regulate your conduct, madam, by my observations; I should
      only give this as a reason for declining the office with which you
      proposed to honour me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady, compelled to speak for herself to her son and daughter, opened
      the affair to them with as much delicacy and address as she had used with
      Mr. Palmer. Their surprise was great; for they had not the most remote
      idea of her intentions. The result of a tedious conversation of three
      hours' length was perfectly satisfactory to her, though it would have been
      to the highest degree painful and mortifying to a woman of more feeling,
      or one less intent upon <i>an establishment</i>, a reversionary title, and
      the Wigram estate. How low she sunk in the opinion of her children and her
      friends was comparatively matter of small consequence to Mrs. Beaumont,
      provided she could keep fair appearances with the world. Whilst her son
      and daughter were so much ashamed of her intended marriage, that they
      would not communicate their sentiments even to each other,&mdash;they,
      with becoming duty, agreed that Mrs. Beaumont was very good in speaking to
      them on the subject; as she had an uncontroulable right to marry as she
      thought proper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaumont now wrote letters innumerable to her extensive circle of
      connexions and acquaintance, announcing her approaching nuptials, and
      inviting them to her wedding. It was settled by Mrs. Beaumont, that the
      three marriages should <i>take place</i> on the same day. This point she
      laboured with her usual address, and at last brought the parties concerned
      to give up their wishes for a private wedding, to gratify her love for
      show and parade. Nothing now remained but to draw the settlements. Mrs.
      Beaumont, who piqued herself upon her skill in business, and who thought
      the sum of wisdom was to excel in cunning, looked over her lawyer's
      drafts, and suggested many nice emendations, which obtained for her from
      an attorney the praise of being a vastly clever woman. Sir John was not,
      on his side, deficient in attention to his own interests. Never was there
      a pair better matched in this respect; never were two people going to be
      married more afraid that each should <i>take the other in</i>. Sir John,
      however, pressed forward the business with an eagerness that surprised
      every body. Mrs. Beaumont again and again examined the settlements, to try
      to account prudentially for her lover's impatience; but she <i>saw</i>
      that <i>all</i> was right there on her part, and her self-love at last
      acquiesced in the belief that Sir John's was now the ardour of a real
      lover. To the lady's entire satisfaction, the liveries, the equipages, the
      diamonds, the wedding-clothes were all bought, and the wedding-day
      approached. Mrs. Beaumont's rich and fashionable connexions and
      acquaintance all promised to grace her nuptials. Nothing was talked of but
      the preparations for Mrs. Beaumont and Sir John Hunter's marriage; and so
      full of business and bustle, and mysteries, and <i>sentimentalities</i>,
      and vanities was she, that she almost forgot that any body was to be
      married but herself. The marriages of her son and daughter seemed so
      completely to merge in the importance and splendour of her own, that she
      merely recollected them as things that were to be done on the same day, as
      subordinate parts that were to be acted by inferior performers, whilst she
      should engross the public interest and applause. In the mean time Miss
      Hunter was engaged, to Mrs. Beaumont's satisfaction and her own, in
      superintending the wedding-dresses, and in preparing the most elegant
      dress imaginable for herself, as bride's-maid. Now and then she
      interrupted these occupations with sighs and fits of pretty sentimental
      dejection; but Mrs. Beaumont was well convinced that a new lover would
      soon make her forget her disappointment. The nephew was written to, and
      invited to spend some time with his aunt, immediately after her marriage;
      for she determined that Miss Hunter should be her niece, since she could
      not be her daughter. This secondary intrigue went on delightfully in our
      heroine's imagination, without interfering with the main business of her
      own marriage. The day, the long-expected day, that was to crown all her
      hopes, at length arrived.

      The following paragraph<a href="#linknote-8" name="linknoteref-8"

    <p>
      "FASHIONABLE HYMENEALS.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yesterday, Sir John Hunter, of Hunter Hall, Devonshire, Bart., led to the
      hymeneal altar the accomplished Mrs. Beaumont, relict of the late Colonel
      Beaumont, of Beaumont Park. On the same day her son and daughter were also
      married&mdash;Mr. Beaumont to Miss Walsingham, daughter of E. Walsingham,
      Esq., of Walsingham House;&mdash;and Miss Beaumont to Captain Walsingham
      of the navy, a near relation of Edward Walsingham, Esq., of Walsingham
      House.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These nuptials in the Beaumont family were graced by an overflowing
      concourse of beauty, nobility, and fashion, comprehending all the
      relations, connexions, intimate friends, and particular acquaintances of
      the interesting and popular Mrs. Beaumont. The cavalcade reached from the
      principal front of the house to the south gate of the park, a distance of
      three-quarters of a mile. Mrs. Beaumont and her daughter, two lovely
      brides, in a superb landau, were attired in the most elegant, becoming,
      fashionable, and costly manner, their dress consisting of the finest lace,
      over white satin. Mrs. Beaumont's was point lace, and she was also
      distinguished by a long veil of the most exquisite texture, which added a
      tempered grace to beauty in its meridian. In the same landau appeared the
      charming brides'-maids, all in white, of course. Among these, Miss Hunter
      attracted particular attention, by the felicity of her costume. Her
      drapery, which was of delicate lace, being happily adapted to show to the
      greatest advantage the captivating contour of her elegant figure, and
      ornamented with white silk fringe and tassels, marked every airy motion of
      her sylph-like form.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The third bride on this auspicious day was Miss Walsingham, who, with her
      father and bride's-maids, followed in Mr. Walsingham's carriage. Miss
      Walsingham, we are informed, was dressed with simple elegance, in the
      finest produce of the Indian loom; but, as she was in a covered carriage,
      we could not obtain a full view of her attire. Next to the brides'
      equipages, followed the bridegrooms'. And chief of these Sir John Hunter
      sported a splendid barouche. He was dressed in the height of the ton, and
      his horses deserved particular admiration. After Sir John's barouche came
      the equipage belonging to Mr. Beaumont, highly finished but plain: in this
      were the two bridegrooms, Mr. Beaumont and Captain Walsingham, accompanied
      by Mr. Palmer (the great West-Indian Palmer), who, we understand, is the
      intimate friend and relative of the Beaumont family. Then followed, as our
      correspondent counted, above a hundred carriages of distinction, with a
      prodigious cavalcade of gentry. The whole was closed by a long line of
      attendants and domestics. The moment the park gates were opened, groups of
      young girls of the Beaumont tenantry, habited in white, with knots of
      ribands, and emblematical devices suited to the occasion, and with baskets
      of flowers in their hands, began to strew vegetable incense before the
      brides, especially before Mrs. Beaumont's landau.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'And whilst the priests accuse the bride's delay,
     Roses and myrtles still obstruct her way.'
</pre>
    <p>
      "The crowd, which assembled as they proceeded along the road to the
      church, and in the churchyard, was such that, however gratefully it
      evinced the popularity of the amiable parties, it became at last evidently
      distressing to the principal object of their homage&mdash;Mrs. Beaumont,
      who could not have stood the gaze of public admiration but for the
      friendly and becoming, yet tantalizing refuge of her veil. Constables were
      obliged to interfere to clear the path to the church door, and the amiable
      almost fainting lady was from the arms of her anxious and alarmed
      bride's-maids lifted out of her landau, and supported into the church and
      up the aisle with all the marked gallantry of true tenderness, by her
      happy bridegroom, Sir John Hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After the ceremony was over, Sir John and Lady Hunter, and the two other
      new-married couples, returned to Beaumont Park with the <i>cortège</i> of
      their friends, where the company partook of an elegant collation. The
      artless graces and fascinating affability of Lady Hunter won all hearts;
      and the wit, festive spirits, and politeness of Sir John, attracted
      universal admiration&mdash;not to say envy, of all present. Immediately
      after the collation, the happy couple set off for their seat at Hunter
      Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Beaumont, and the new Mrs. Beaumont, remained at Beaumont Park.
      Captain and Mrs. Walsingham repaired to Mr. Walsingham's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a singular circumstance, communicated to us by the indisputable
      authority of one of the bride's-maids, that Miss Walsingham, as it was
      discovered after the ceremony, was actually married with her gown the
      wrong side outwards. Whether this be an omen announcing good fortune to <i>all</i>
      the parties concerned, we cannot take upon us to determine; but this much
      we may safely assert, that never distinguished female in the annals of
      fashion was married under more favourable auspices than the amiable Lady
      Hunter. And it is universally acknowledged, that no lady is better suited
      to be, as in the natural course of things she will soon be, Countess of
      Puckeridge, and at the head of the great Wigram estate."

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      So ends our newspaper writer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably this paragraph was sent to the press before the <i>fashionable
      hymeneals</i> had actually taken place. This may in some measure account
      for the extraordinary omissions in the narrative. After the three
      marriages had been solemnized, just when the ceremony was over, and Lady
      Hunter was preparing to receive the congratulations of the brilliant
      congregation, she observed that the clergyman, instead of shutting his
      book, kept it open before him, and looked round as if expecting another
      bride. Mrs. Beaumont, we should say Lady Hunter, curtsied to him, smiled,
      and made a sign that the ceremony was finished; but at this instant, to
      her astonishment, she saw her bride's-maid, Miss Hunter, quit her place,
      and beheld Captain Lightbody seize her hand, and lead her up towards the
      altar. Lady Hunter broke through the crowd that was congratulating her,
      and reaching Miss Hunter, drew her hack forcibly, and whispered, "Are you
      mad, Miss Hunter? Is this a place, a time for frolic? What are you about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going to be married, ma'am! following your ladyship's good example,"
      answered her bride's-maid, flippantly,&mdash;at the same time springing
      forward from the detaining grasp, regardless even of the rent she made in
      her lace dress, she hurried, or was hurried on by Captain Lightbody.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Captain Lightbody!" cried Lady Hunter; but, answering only with a
      triumphant bow, he passed on with his bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heavens! will nobody stop him?" cried Lady Hunter, over-taking them again
      as they reached the steps. She addressed herself to the clergyman. "Sir,
      she is a ward in chancery, and under my protection: they have no licence;
      their banns have not been published: you cannot, dare not, surely, marry
      them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, Lady Hunter," said Captain Lightbody; "I have shown Mr. Twigg
      my licence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have seen it&mdash;I thought it was with your ladyship's knowledge,"
      replied Mr. Twigg. "I&mdash;I cannot object&mdash;it would be at my own
      peril. If there is any lawful impediment, your ladyship will make it at
      the proper response."
    </p>
    <p>
      A friend of Captain Lightbody's appeared in readiness to give the young
      lady away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ceremony must go on, madam," said the clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At your peril, sir!" said Lady Hunter. "This young lady, is a ward of
      chancery, and not of age!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am of age&mdash;of age last month," cried the bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not till next year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of age last month. I have the parish register," said Captain Lightbody.
      "Go on, sir, if you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens! Miss Hunter, can you bear," said Lady Hunter, "to be the
      object of this indecent altercation? Retire with me, and only let me speak
      to you, I conjure you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      No&mdash;the young lady stood her ground, resolute to be a bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If there is any lawful impediment, your ladyship will please to make it
      at the proper response," said the chaplain. "I am under a necessity of
      proceeding."
    </p>
    <p>
      The ceremony went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Hunter, in high indignation, retired immediately to the vestry-room
      with her bridegroom. "At least," cried she, throwing herself upon a seat,
      "it shall never be said that I countenanced, by my presence, such a
      scandalous marriage! Oh! Sir John Hunter, why did you not interfere to
      save your own sister?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Save her! Egad, she did not choose to be saved. Who can save a woman that
      does not choose it? What could I do? Is not she your ladyship's pupil?&mdash;he!
      he! he! But I'll fight the rascal directly, if that will give you any
      satisfaction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he shall have a lawsuit too for her fortune!" said Lady Hunter; "for
      she is not of age. I have a memorandum in an old pocket book. Oh! who
      would have thought such a girl could have duped me so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Hunter's exclamations were interrupted by the entrance of her son and
      daughter, who came to offer what consolation they could. The brilliant
      congregation poured in a few minutes afterwards, with their mingled
      congratulations and condolence, eager, above all things, to satisfy their
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lightbody, with invincible assurance, came up just as Lady Hunter
      was getting into her carriage, and besought permission to present his
      bride to her. But Lady Hunter, turning her back upon him without reply,
      said to her son, "If Captain Lightbody is going to Beaumont Park, I am not
      going there."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lightbody, who was now emancipated from all control, and from all
      sense of propriety, called out from her <i>own</i> carriage, in which she
      was seated, "That, thank Heaven! she had a house of her own to go to, and
      that nothing was farther from her thoughts than to interrupt the
      festivities of Lady Hunter's more mature nuptials."
    </p>
    <p>
      Delighted with having made this tart answer, Mrs. Lightbody ordered her
      husband to order her coachman to drive off as fast as possible. The
      captain, by her particular desire, had taken a house for her at Brighton,
      the gayest place she could think of. We leave this amiable bride rejoicing
      in the glory of having duped a lady of Mrs. Beaumont's penetration; and
      her bridegroom rejoicing still more in the parish register, by the help of
      which he hoped to obtain full enjoyment of what he knew to be his bride's
      most valuable possession&mdash;her portion, and to defy Lady Hunter's
      threatened lawsuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time, Lady Hunter, in her point lace and beautiful veil,
      seated beside her baronet, in his new barouche, endeavoured to forget this
      interruption of her triumph. She considered, that though Miss Hunter's
      fortune was lost to her family, yet the title of countess, and the Wigram
      estate, were <i>secure</i>: this was solid consolation; and recovering her
      features from their unprecedented discomposure, she forced smiles and
      looks suitable to the occasion, as she bowed to congratulating passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at Beaumont Park, she prepared, without appetite, to partake of
      the elegant collation, and to do the honours with her accustomed grace:
      she took care to seat Mr. Palmer beside her, that she might show the world
      on what good terms they were together. She was pleased to see, that though
      two younger brides sat near her, she engaged by far the largest share of
      public admiration. They were so fully content and engrossed by their own
      feelings, that they did not perceive that they were what is called <i>thrown
      into the shade</i>. All the pride, pomp, and circumstance of these
      glorious hymeneals appeared to them but as a dream, or as a scene that was
      acting before them, in which they were not called to take a part. Towards
      the end of the collation, one of the guests, my Lord Rider, a nobleman who
      always gave himself the air of being in a prodigious hurry, declared that
      he was under the necessity of going off, for he expected a person to meet
      him at his house in town, on some particular business, at an appointed
      day. His lordship's travelling companion, who was unwilling to quit so
      prematurely the present scene of festivity, observed that the man of
      business had engaged to write to his lordship, and that he should at least
      wait till the post should come in. Lady Hunter politely sent to inquire if
      any letters had arrived for his lordship; and, in consequence of his
      impatience, all the letters for the family were brought: Lady Hunter
      distributed them. There was one for Captain Walsingham, with a Spanish
      motto on the seal: Lady Hunter, as she gave it to him, whispered to
      Amelia, "Don't be jealous, my dear, but that, I can tell you, is a letter
      from his Spanish incognita." Amelia smiled with a look of the most perfect
      confidence and love. Captain Walsingham immediately opened the letter,
      and, looking at the signature, said, "It is not from my Spanish incognita,&mdash;it
      is from her aunt; I will read it by and by."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fine evasion, indeed!" exclaimed Lady Hunter: "look how coolly he puts
      it into his pocket! Ah! my credulous Amelia, do you allow him to begin in
      this manner?" pursued she, in a tone of raillery, yet as if she really
      suspected something wrong in the letter; "and have you no <i>curiosity</i>,
      Mrs. Walsingham?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelia declared that she had none; that she was not one of those who think
      that jealousy is the best proof of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right, right," said Mr. Palmer; "confidence is the best proof of love;
      and yours, I'll venture to say, is, and ever will be, well placed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Walsingham, with a grateful smile, took his letter again out of
      his pocket, and immediately began to read it in a low voice to Amelia,
      Lady Hunter, and Mr. Palmer.

      "DEAR SIR,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Though almost a stranger to you, I should think myself wanting in
      gratitude if I did not, after all the services you have done my family,
      write to thank you in my niece's name and in my own: and much I regret
      that my words will so ill convey to you the sentiments of our hearts. I am
      an old woman, not well accustomed to use my pen in the way of
      letter-writing; but can say truly, that whilst I have life I shall be
      grateful to you. You have restored me to happiness by restoring to me my
      long-lost niece. It will, I am sure, give you satisfaction to hear, that
      my niece&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Walsingham stopped short, with a look which confirmed Lady Hunter
      in all her suspicions,&mdash;which made Mr. Palmer take out his snuff-box,&mdash;which
      startled even Mr. Beaumont; but which did not raise in the mind of Amelia
      the slightest feeling of doubt or suspicion. She smiled, and looked round
      at her alarmed friends with a manner which seemed to say, "Can you suppose
      it possible that there can be any thing wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray go on, Captain Walsingham," said Lady Hunter, "unless&mdash;unless
      you have particular, very particular reasons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have particular, very particular reasons," said Captain Walsingham;
      "and since," turning to Amelia, "this confiding lady does not insist upon
      my going on&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Lady Hunter, gaily, snatching the letter, "I am not such a
      credulous, or, as you call it, confiding lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg of your ladyship not to read it," said Captain Walsingham, in an
      earnest tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You beg of me not to read it, and with that alarmed look&mdash;Oh!
      positively, I must, and will read it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at present, then, I entreat you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This very instant," cried Lady Hunter, affecting all the imperious
      vivacity of a young bride, under favour of which she determined to satisfy
      her malicious curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray, Lady Hunter, do not read it," repeated Captain Walsingham, laying
      his hand over the letter. "It is for your own sake," added he, in a low
      and earnest voice, "it is for your own sake, not mine, that I beg of you
      to forbear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Hunter, imagining this to be only a subterfuge, drew the letter from
      beneath Captain Walsingham's hand, exclaiming, "For <i>my sake!</i> Oh,
      Captain, that is a charming <i>ruse de guerre</i>, but do not hope that it
      shall succeed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! mother, believe him, believe him," cried Amelia: "I am sure he tells
      you the truth, and he speaks for your sake, not for his own."
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelia interceded in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Palmer patted Amelia's shoulder fondly, saying, "You are a dear good
      creature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A dear credulous creature!" exclaimed Lady Hunter. She had now
      undisturbed possession of the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Walsingham stood by with a face of great concern; in which Amelia
      and Mr. Beaumont, without knowing the cause, seemed to sympathize.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contest had early attracted the attention of all within hearing or
      view of her ladyship, and by this time had been pointed out and accounted
      for in whispers, even to the most remote parts of the room; so that the
      eyes of almost every individual in the assembly were now fixed upon Lady
      Hunter. She had scarcely glanced her eye upon the letter, when she turned
      pale as death, and exclaimed, "He knew it! he knew it!" Then, recollecting
      herself, she made a struggle to conceal her dismay&mdash;the forced smile
      quivered on her lip,&mdash;she fell back in a swoon, and was carried out
      of the room by her son and daughter. Sir John Hunter was at another table,
      eating eel-pie, and was the last person present who was made to understand
      what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the damned heat of the room, I suppose," said he, "that made her
      faint;" and swallowing the last morsel on his plate, and settling his
      collar, he came up to Captain Walsingham. "What's this I hear?&mdash;that
      Lady Hunter has fainted? I hope they have carried her into the air. But
      where's the letter they say affected her so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In my pocket," said Captain Walsingham, coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any thing new in it?" said Sir John, with a sulky, fashionable
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing new to you, probably, Sir John," said Captain Walsingham, walking
      away from him in disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose it was the heat overcame Lady Hunter," continued Sir John,
      speaking to those who stood near him. "Is any body gone to see how she is
      now? I wonder if they'll let me in to see her."
    </p>
    <p>
      With assumed carelessness, but with real embarrassment, the bridegroom
      went to inquire for his bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good Mr. Palmer went soon afterwards, and knocked softly at the lady's
      door. "Is poor Lady Hunter any better?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! yes; quite well again now," cried Lady Hunter, raising herself from
      the bed, on which she had been laid; but Mr. Palmer thought, as he saw her
      through the half-opened door, she still looked a deplorable spectacle, in
      all her wedding finery. "Quite well again, now: it was nothing in the
      world but the heat. Amelia, my love, go back to the company, and say so,
      lest my friends should be uneasy. Thank you, kind Mr. Palmer, for coming
      to see me: excuse my not being able to let you in now, for I must change
      my dress. Sir John sends me word his barouche will be at the door in ten
      minutes, and I have to hurry on my travelling dress. Excuse me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Palmer retired, seeing clearly that she wished to avoid any
      explanation of the real cause of her fainting. In the gallery, leading
      from her room, he met Captain Walsingham, who was coming to inquire for
      Lady Hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor woman! do you know the cause of her fainting?" said Captain
      Walsingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; and I believe she does not wish me to know it: therefore don't tell
      it me," said Mr. Palmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a secret that must be in the public papers in a few days," said
      Captain Walsingham. "This lady that I brought over from Lisbon&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what can she have to say to Mrs. Beaumont?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing to Mrs. Beaumont, but a great deal to Lady Hunter. You may
      remember that I mentioned to you that some of her relations had contrived
      to have her kept in that convent abroad, and had spread a report of her
      death, that the heir-at-law might defraud her of her property, and get and
      keep possession of a large estate, which fell to him in case of her death.
      Of further particulars, or even of the name of this estate, I knew nothing
      till this morning, when that letter from the aunt&mdash;here it is&mdash;tells
      me, that the estate to which her niece was entitled is the great Wigram
      estate, and that old Wigram was the rascally heir-at-law. The lawyer I
      recommended to the lady was both an honest and a clever fellow; and he
      represented so forcibly to old Wigram the consequences of his having his
      fraud brought to light in a court of equity, that he made him soon agree
      to a private reference. The affair has been compromised, and settled thus:&mdash;The
      possession of the estate is given up, just as it stands, to the rightful
      owner; and she forbears to call the old sinner to an account for past
      arrears. She will let him make it out to the world and to his own
      conscience, if he can, that he bona-fide believed her to be dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So," said Mr. Palmer, "so end Madam Beaumont's hopes of being at the head
      of the Wigram estate, and so end her hopes of being a countess!&mdash;And
      actually married to this ruined spendthrift!&mdash;Now we see the reason
      he pressed on the match so, and urged her to marry him before the affair
      should become public. She is duped, and for life!&mdash;poor Madam
      Beaumont!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Lady Hunter came out of her room, after having changed her
      dress, and repaired her smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ready for my journey now," said she, passing by Mr. Palmer quickly. "I
      must show myself to the world of friends below, and bid them adieu. One
      word, Captain Walsingham: there's no occasion, you know," whispered she,
      "to say any thing <i>below</i> of that letter; I really don't believe it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Too proud to let her mortification be known, Lady Hunter constrained her
      feelings with all her might. She appeared once more with a pleased
      countenance in the festive assembly. She received their compliments and
      congratulations, and invited them, with all the earnestness of friendship,
      to favour Sir John and her, as soon as possible, with their company at
      Hunter Hall. The company were now fast departing; carriages came to the
      door in rapid succession. Lady Hunter went through with admirable grace
      and variety the sentimental ceremony of taking leave; and when her
      splendid barouche was at the door, and when she was to bid adieu to her
      own family, still she acted her part inimitably. In all the becoming mixed
      smiles and tears of a bride, she was seen embracing by turns her beloved
      daughter and son, and daughter-in-law and son-in-law, over and over again,
      in the hall, on the steps; to the last moment contriving to be torn
      delightfully from the bosom of her family by her impatient bridegroom.
      Seated beside him in his barouche, she kissed her hand to Mr. Palmer,&mdash;smiled:
      all her family, who stood on the steps, bowed; and Sir John drove away
      with his prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a swindler!" cried Mr. Palmer, "and she is&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amelia's mother," interrupted Captain Walsingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right," said Mr. Palmer; "but Amelia had a father too,&mdash;my excellent
      friend, Colonel Beaumont,&mdash;whom she and her brother resemble in all
      that is open-hearted and honourable. Well, well! I make no reflections; I
      hate moral reflections. Every body can think and feel for themselves, I
      presume. I only say,&mdash;Thank Heaven, we've done with <i>manoeuvring!</i>"

    <h2>
      ALMERIA.
    </h2>
    <p>
      John Hodgkinson was an eminent and wealthy Yorkshire grazier, who had no
      children of his own, but who had brought up in his family Almeria
      Turnbull, the daughter of his wife by a former husband, a Mr. Turnbull.
      Mr. Turnbull had also been a grazier, but had not been successful in the
      management of his affairs, therefore he could not leave his daughter any
      fortune; and at the death of her mother, she became entirely dependent on
      her father-in-law. Old Hodgkinson was a whimsical man, who, except in
      eating and drinking, had no inclination to spend any part of the fortune
      he had made; but, enjoying the consequence which money confers,
      endeavoured to increase this importance by keeping all his acquaintance in
      uncertainty, as to what he called his "<i>testamentary dispositions</i>."
      Sometimes he hinted that his step-daughter should be a match for the
      proudest riband in England; sometimes he declared, that he did not know of
      what use money could be to a woman, except to make her a prey to a
      fortune-hunter, and that his girl should not be left in a way to be duped.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to his daughter's education, that was an affair in which he did not
      interfere: all that he wished was, that the girl should be kept humble,
      and have no fine notions put into her head, nor any communication with
      fine people. He kept company only with men of his own sort; and as he had
      no taste for any kind of literature, Almeria's time would have hung rather
      heavy upon her hands, had she been totally confined to his society: but,
      fortunately for her, there lived in the neighbourhood an elderly gentleman
      and his daughter, whom her father allowed her to visit. Mr. Elmour was a
      country gentleman of a moderate fortune, a respectable family, and of a
      most amiable character: between his daughter Ellen and Miss Turnbull there
      had subsisted an intimacy from their earliest childhood. The professions
      of this friendship had hitherto been much the warmest on the part of
      Almeria; the proofs were, perhaps, the strongest on the side of Ellen.
      Miss Elmour, as the daughter of a gentleman, whose family had been long
      settled in the country, was rather <i>more considered</i> than Miss
      Turnbull, who was the daughter of a grazier, whose money had but lately
      raised him to the level of gentility. At Mr. Elmour's house Almeria had an
      opportunity of being in much better company than she could ever have seen
      at her father's; better company in every respect, but chiefly in the
      popular, or more properly in the aristocratic sense of the term: her
      visits had consequently been long and frequent; she appeared to have a
      peculiar taste for refinement in manners and conversation, and often
      deplored the want she felt of these at home. She expressed a strong desire
      to acquire information, and to improve herself in every elegant
      accomplishment; and Ellen, who was of a character far superior to the
      little meanness of female competition and jealousy, shared with her friend
      all the advantages of her situation. Old Hodgkinson never had any books in
      his house, but such as Almeria borrowed from Mr. Elmour's library. Ellen
      constantly sent Miss Turnbull all the new publications which her father
      got from town&mdash;she copied for her friend the new music with which she
      was supplied, showed her every new drawing or print, gave her the
      advantage of the lessons she received from an excellent drawing master,
      and let her into those little mysteries of art which masters sometimes
      sell so dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was done with perfect readiness and simplicity: Ellen never seemed
      conscious that she was bestowing a favour; but appeared to consider what
      she did as matters of course, or as the necessary consequences of
      friendship. She treated her friend at all times, and in all companies,
      with that uniform attention and equality of manner, which most people
      profess, and which so few have strength of mind to practise. Almeria
      expressed, and probably at this time felt, unbounded gratitude and
      affection for Ellen; indeed her expressions were sometimes so vehement,
      that Miss Elmour rallied her for being romantic. Almeria one day declared,
      that she should wish to pass all the days of her life at Elmour Grove,
      without seeing any other human creatures but her friend and her friend's
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your imagination deceives you, my dear Almeria," said Ellen, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is my heart, not my imagination, that speaks," said Almeria, laying
      her hand upon her heart, or upon the place where she fancied her heart
      ought to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your understanding will, perhaps, speak a different language by and by,
      and your heart will not be the worse for it, my good young lady," said old
      Mr. Elmour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almeria persisted even to tears; and it was not till young Mr. Elmour came
      home, and till she had spent a few weeks in his company, that she began to
      admit that three was the number sacred to friendship. Frederick Elmour was
      a man of honour, talents, spirit, and of a decided character: he was
      extremely fond of his sister, and was prepossessed in favour of every
      thing and person that she loved. Her intimate friend was consequently
      interesting to him; and it must be supposed, that Miss Elmour's praises of
      Almeria were managed more judiciously than eulogiums usually are, by the
      effect which they produced. Frederick became attached to Miss Turnbull,
      though he perceived that, in firmness and dignity of character, she was
      not equal to his sister. This inferiority did not injure her in his
      opinion, because it was always acknowledged with so much candour and
      humility by Almeria, who seemed to look up to her friend as to a being of
      a superior order. This freedom from envy, and this generous enthusiasm,
      first touched young Mr. Elmour's heart. Next to possessing his sister's
      virtues and talents, loving them was, in his opinion, the greatest merit.
      He thought that a person capable of appreciating and admiring Ellen's
      character, must be desirous of imitating her; and the similarity of their
      tastes, opinions, and principles, seemed to him the most secure pledge for
      his future happiness. Miss Turnbull's fortune, whatever it might be, was
      an object of no great importance to him: his father, though not opulent,
      was in easy circumstances, and was "willing," he said, "to deprive himself
      of some luxuries for the sake of his son, whom he would not controul in
      the choice of a wife&mdash;a choice on which he knew, from his own
      experience, that the happiness of life so much depends."
    </p>
    <p>
      The benevolent old gentleman had peculiar merit in this conduct; because
      if he had a weakness in the world, it was a prejudice in favour of what is
      called <i>good family and birth</i>: it had long been the secret wish of
      his heart that his only son might marry into a family as ancient as his
      own. Frederick was fully sensible of the sacrifice that his father made of
      his pride: but that which he was willing to make of what he called his
      luxuries, his son's affection and sense of justice forbade him to accept.
      He could not rob his father of any of the comforts of his declining years,
      whilst in the full vigour of youth it was in his power, by his own
      exertions, to obtain an independent maintenance. He had been bred to the
      bar; no expense had been spared by his father in his education, no efforts
      had been omitted by himself. He was now ready to enter on the duties of
      his profession with ardour, but without presumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our heroine must be pardoned by the most prudent, and admired by the most
      romantic, for being desperately in love with a youth of such a character
      and such expectations. Whilst the young lady's passion was growing every
      hour more lively, her old father was growing every hour more lethargic. He
      had a superstitious dread of making a will, as if it were a preparation
      for death, which would hasten the fatal moment. Hodgkinson's friends tried
      to conquer this prejudice: but it was in vain to reason with a man who had
      never reasoned during the whole of his life about any thing except
      bullocks. Old Hodgkinson died&mdash;that was a matter of no great
      consequence to any body&mdash;but he died without a will, and that was a
      matter of some importance to his daughter. After searching in every
      probable and improbable place, there was, at length, found in his own
      handwriting a memorandum, the beginning of which was in the first leaf of
      his cookery-book, and the end in the last leaf of his prayer-book. There
      was some difficulty in deciphering the memorandum, for it was cross-barred
      with miscellaneous observations in inks of various colours&mdash;red,
      blue, and green. As it is dangerous to garble law papers, we shall lay the
      document before the public just as it appeared.

      Now it happened, that Mr. Hodgkinson's namesake and relation disdained the
      ten thousand pounds legacy, and claimed the whole property as heir-at-law.
      Almeria, who was utterly unacquainted with business, applied to Mr. Elmour
      in this difficulty, and he had the goodness to undertake the management of
      her affairs. Frederick engaged to carry on her law-suit, and to plead her
      cause against this rapacious Mr. Hodgkinson of Hull.&mdash;Whilst the suit
      was pending, Miss Turnbull had an opportunity of seeing something of the
      ways of the world; for the manners of her Yorkshire acquaintance, of all
      but Ellen and the Elmours, varied towards her, according to the opinion
      formed of the probable event of the trial on which her fortune depended.
      She felt these variations most keenly. In particular, she was provoked by
      the conduct of Lady Stock, who was at this time <i>the</i> fashionable
      lady of York: Sir Thomas, her husband, was a great banker; and whenever
      she condescended to visit her friends in the country, she shone upon them
      in all the splendour and pride of wealth. Miss Turnbull, immediately after
      her father's death, went, accompanied by old Mr. Elmour, to Sir Thomas
      Stock, to settle accounts with him: she was received by his lady as a
      great heiress, with infinite civility; her visit punctually returned, and
      an invitation to dinner sent to her and the Elmours with all due
      expedition. As she seemed to wish to accept of it, her friends agreed to
      accompany her, though in general they disliked fine dinners; and though
      they seldom left their retirement to mix in the gaieties of York. Miss
      Turnbull was received in rather a different manner from what she expected
      upon this occasion; for between the sending and the accepting of the
      invitation, Lady Stock had heard that her title to the fortune was
      disputed, and that many were of an opinion that, instead of having two
      hundred thousand pounds, she would not have a shilling. Almeria was
      scarcely noticed, on her entrance, by the lady of the house; she found
      herself in a formidable circle, where every body seemed to consider her as
      being out of her place. At dinner she was suffered to go to a side-table.
      From the moment she entered the house till she left it, Lady Stock never
      deigned to speak to her, nor for one instant to recollect that such a
      person existed. Not even Madame Roland, when she was sent to the second
      table at the fermier general's, expressed more indignation than Almeria
      did, at the insolence of this banker's lady. She could think and speak of
      nothing else, all the time she was going home in the evening to Elmour
      Grove. Ellen, who had more philosophy than our heroine, did not sympathize
      in the violence of her indignation: on the contrary, she was surprised
      that Almeria could feel so much hurt by the slights of a woman, for whom
      she had neither esteem nor affection, and with whom she was indeed
      scarcely acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But does not her conduct excite your indignation?" said Miss Turnbull.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No: it rather deserves my contempt. If a friend&mdash;if you, for
      instance, had treated me in such a manner, it would have provoked my
      anger, I dare say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I! Oh, how impossible!" cried Almeria. "Such insufferable pride! Such
      downright rudeness!&mdash;She was tolerably civil to you, but me she never
      noticed: and this sudden change, it seems, Frederick, arises from her
      doubts of my fortune.&mdash;Is not such meanness really astonishing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be astonishing, perhaps," replied Frederick, "if we did not see
      similar instances every day.&mdash;Lady Stock, you know, is nothing but a
      mere woman of the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hate mere women of the world," cried Almeria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen observed, that it was not worth while to hate, it was sufficient to
      avoid them.&mdash;Almeria grew warmer in her abhorrence; and Ellen at last
      expressed, half in jest, half in earnest, some fear, that if Miss Turnbull
      felt with such exquisite sensibility the neglect of persons of fashion,
      she might in a different situation be ambitious, or vain of their favour.
      Almeria was offended, and was very near quarrelling with her friend for
      harbouring such a mean opinion of her character.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you imagine that <i>I could</i> ever make a friend of such a person as
      Lady Stock?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A friend! far from it. I am very sure that you could not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then how could I be ambitious of her favour? I am desirous only of the
      favour, esteem, and affection of my friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But people who live in what is called the world, you know, my dear
      Almeria, desire to have acquaintance as well as friends," said Ellen; "and
      they value those by their fashion or rank, and by the honour which may be
      received from their notice in public places."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear," interrupted Almeria; "though I have never been in London,
      as you have, I understand all that perfectly well, I assure you; but I
      only say, that I am certain I should never judge, and that I should never
      act, in such a manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen smiled, and said, "It is difficult to be certain of what we should
      do in situations in which we have never been placed."&mdash;Almeria burst
      into tears, and her friend could scarcely pacify her by the kindest
      expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Observe, my dear Almeria, that I said <i>we,</i> not <i>you</i>: I do not
      pretend that, till I have been tried, I could be certain of my own
      strength of mind in new situations: I believe it is from weakness, that
      people are often so desirous of the notice of persons for whom they have
      no esteem. If I were forced to live among a certain set of company, I
      suppose I should, in time, do just as they do; for I confess, that I do
      not think I could bear every day to be utterly neglected in society, even
      such as we have been in to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Almeria wondered to hear her friend speak with so little confidence of her
      own spirit and independence; and vehemently declared that she was certain
      no change of external circumstances could make any alteration in her
      sentiments and feelings. Ellen forbore to press the subject farther,
      although the proofs which Almeria had this day given of her stoicism were
      not absolutely conclusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a month after this conversation had passed, the suit against Miss
      Turnbull, to set aside Mr. Hodgkinson's will, was tried at York. The court
      was crowded at an early hour; for much entertainment was expected, from
      the oddity of old Hodgkinson's <i>testamentary dispositions</i>: besides,
      the large amount of the property at stake could not fail to make the cause
      interesting. Several ladies appeared in the galleries; among the rest,
      Lady Stock&mdash;Miss Elmour was there also, to accompany Almeria&mdash;Frederick
      was one of her counsel; and when it came to his turn to speak, he pleaded
      her cause with so much eloquence and ability, as to obtain universal
      approbation. After a trial, which lasted many hours, a verdict was given
      in Miss Turnbull's favour. An immediate change appeared in the manners of
      all her acquaintance&mdash;they crowded round her with smiles and
      congratulations; and persons with whom she was scarcely acquainted, or who
      had, till now, hardly deigned to acknowledge her acquaintance, accosted
      her with an air of intimacy. Lady Stock, in particular, recovered, upon
      this occasion, both her sight and speech: she took Almeria's hand most
      graciously, and went on chattering with the greatest volubility, as they
      stood at the door of the court-house. Her ladyship's handsome equipage had
      drawn up, and she offered to carry Miss Turnbull home: Almeria excused
      herself, but felt ashamed, when she saw the look of contempt which her
      ladyship bestowed on Mr. Elmour's old coach, which was far behind a number
      of others, and which could but ill bear a comparison with a new London
      carriage. Angry with herself for this weakness, our heroine endeavoured to
      conceal it even from her own mind; and feelings of gratitude to her
      friends revived in her heart the moment she was out of the sight of her
      fine acquaintance. She treated Ellen with even more than usual fondness;
      and her acknowledgments of obligation to her counsel and his father were
      expressed in the strongest terms. In a few days, there came a pressing
      invitation from Lady Stock; Mr. Elmour had accounts of Miss Turnbull's to
      settle with Sir Thomas, and, notwithstanding the air of indifference with
      which she read the cards, Almeria was not sorry to accept of the
      invitation, as she knew that she should be received in a very different
      manner from that in which she had been treated on her former visit. She
      laughed, and said, "that she should be entertained by observing the change
      which a few thousand pounds more or less could produce in Lady Stock's
      behaviour." Yet, such is the inconsistency or the weakness of human
      wishes, that the very attentions which our heroine knew were paid merely
      to her fortune, and not to her merit, flattered her vanity; and she
      observed, with a strange mixture of pain and pleasure, that there was a
      marked difference in Lady Stock's manner towards her and <i>the Elmours</i>.
      When the evening was over, and when she "had leisure to be good," Almeria
      called herself severely to account for this secret satisfaction, of which
      she had been conscious from the preference given her over her friends&mdash;she
      accused herself of ingratitude, and endeavoured to recover her own
      self-complacency by redoubled professions of esteem and affection for
      those to whom she had so much reason to be attached. But fresh invitations
      came from Lady Stock, and the course of her thoughts again changed. Ellen
      declined accompanying her; and Miss Turnbull regretted this exceedingly,
      because it would be so distressing and awkward for her to go <i>alone</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why do you go at all, my dear?" said Ellen; "you speak as if there
      were some moral necessity for your visit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Moral necessity! oh, no," said Almeria, laughing; "but I really think
      there is a <i>polite</i> necessity, if you will allow me the expression.
      Would it not be rude for all of us to refuse, when Lady Stock has made
      this music party, as she says, entirely on my account&mdash;on our
      account, I mean? for you see she mentions your fondness for music; and if
      she had not written so remarkably civilly to you, I assure you I would
      neither go myself, nor think of pressing you to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      This oratory had no effect upon Ellen: our heroine went alone to the music
      meeting. The old coach returned to Elmour Grove at night, empty&mdash;the
      servant brought "Lady Stock's compliments, and she would send her carriage
      home with Miss Turnbull early the next morning." After waiting above an
      hour and a half beyond their usual time, the family were sitting down to
      dinner the next day, when Miss Turnbull, in Lady Stock's fine carriage,
      drove up the avenue&mdash;Frederick handed her out of the carriage with
      more ceremony and less affection than he had ever shown before. Old Mr.
      Elmour's manner was also more distant, and Ellen's colder. Almeria
      attempted to apologize, but could not get through her speech:&mdash;she
      then tried to laugh at her own awkwardness; but her laugh not being
      seconded, she sat down to dinner in silence, colouring prodigiously, and
      totally abashed. Good old Mr. Elmour was the first to relent, and to
      endeavour, by resuming his usual kind familiarity, to relieve her painful
      confusion. Ellen's coolness was also dissipated when Miss Turnbull took
      her aside after dinner, and with tears in her eyes declared, "she was
      sorry she had not had sufficient strength of mind to resist Lady Stock's
      importunities to stay all night;&mdash;that as to the carriage, it was
      sent back without her knowledge; and that this morning, though she had
      three or four times expressed her fears that she should keep her friends
      at Elmour Grove waiting for dinner, yet Lady Stock would not understand
      her hints;" and she declared, "she got away the very instant her
      ladyship's carriage came to the door." By Ellen's kind interposition,
      Frederick, whose pride had been most ready to take the alarm at the least
      appearance of slight to his father and sister, was pacified&mdash;he laid
      aside his ceremony to <i>Miss Turnbull</i>; called her "Almeria," as he
      used to do&mdash;and all was well again. With difficulty and blushes,
      Almeria came out with an after-confession, that she had been so silly as
      to make half a promise to Lady Stock, of going to her ball, and of
      spending a few days with her at York, before she left the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But this promise was only conditional," said she: "if you or your father
      would take it the least ill or unkindly of me, I assure you I will not go&mdash;I
      would rather offend all the Lady Stocks in the world than you, my dearest
      Ellen, or your father, to whom I am so much obliged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not talk of obligations," interrupted Ellen; "amongst friends there
      can be no obligations. I will answer for it that my father will not be
      offended at your going to this ball; and I assure you I shall not take it
      unkindly. If you would not think me very proud, I should tell you that I
      wish for our sakes, as well as your own, that you should see as much of
      this Lady Stock, and as many <i>Lady Stocks</i>, as possible; for I am
      convinced that, upon <i>intimate</i> acquaintance, we must rise in your
      opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Almeria protested that she had never for an instant thought of comparing
      Ellen with Lady Stock. "A friend, a bosom friend, with an acquaintance&mdash;an
      acquaintance of yesterday!&mdash;I never thought of making such a
      comparison."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the very thing of which I complain," said Ellen, smiling: "I beg
      you will make the comparison, my dear Almeria; and the more opportunities
      you have of forming your judgment, the better."
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding that there was something rather humiliating to Miss
      Turnbull in the dignified composure with which Ellen now, for the first
      time in her life, implied her own superiority, Almeria secretly rejoiced
      that it was at her friend's own request that the visits to her fine
      acquaintance were repeated. At Lady Stock's ball Miss Turnbull was much <i>distinguished,</i>
      as it is called&mdash;Sir Thomas's eldest son was her partner; and though
      he was not remarkably agreeable, yet his attentions were flattering to her
      vanity, because the rival belles of York vied for his homage. The delight
      of being taken notice of in public was new to Almeria, and it quite
      intoxicated her brain. Six hours' sleep afterwards were not sufficient to
      sober her completely; as her friends at Elmour Grove perceived the next
      morning&mdash;she neither talked, looked, nor moved like herself, though
      she was perfectly unconscious that in this delirium of vanity and
      affectation she was an object of pity and disgust to the man she loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen had sufficient good-nature and candour to make allowance for foibles
      in others from which her own character was totally free; she was
      clear-sighted to the merits, but not blind to the faults, of her friends;
      and she resolved to wait patiently till Almeria should return to herself.
      Miss Turnbull, in compliance with her friend's advice, took as many
      opportunities as possible of being with Lady Stock. Her ladyship's company
      was by no means agreeable to Almeria's natural taste; for her ladyship had
      neither sense nor knowledge, and her conversation consisted merely of
      common-place phrases, or the second-hand affectation of fashionable
      nonsense: yet, though Miss Turnbull felt no actual pleasure in her
      company, she was vain of being of her parties, and even condescended to
      repeat some of her sayings, in which there was neither sense nor wit. From
      having lived much in the London world, her ladyship was acquainted with a
      prodigious number of names of persona of consequence and quality; and by
      these our heroine's ears were charmed. Her ladyship's dress was also an
      object of admiration and imitation, and the York ladies begged patterns of
      every thing she wore. Almeria consequently thought that no other clothes
      could be worn with propriety; and she was utterly ashamed of her past self
      for having lived so long in ignorance, and for having had so bad a taste,
      as ever to have thought Ellen Elmour a model for imitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Elmour," her ladyship said, "was a very sensible young woman, no
      doubt; but she could hardly be considered as a model of fashion."
    </p>
    <p>
      A new standard for estimating merit was raised in Almeria's mind; and her
      friend, for an instant, sunk before the vast advantage of having the most
      fashionable mantua-maker and milliner in town. Ashamed of this dereliction
      of principle, she a few minutes afterwards warmly pronounced a panegyric
      on Ellen, to which Lady Stock only replied with a vacant, supercilious
      countenance, "May be so&mdash;no doubt&mdash;of course&mdash;the Elmours
      are a very respectable family, I'm told&mdash;and really more genteel than
      the country families one sees: but is not it odd, they don't <i>mix more?</i>
      One seldom meets them in town any where, or at any of the watering-places
      in summer."
    </p>
    <p>
      To this charge, Almeria, with blushes, was forced to plead guilty for her
      friends: she, however, observed, in mitigation, "that when they were in
      town, what company they did see was always the best, she believed&mdash;that
      she knew, for one person, the Duchess of A&mdash;&mdash; was a friend of
      the Elmours, and corresponded with Ellen."
    </p>
    <p>
      This judicious defence produced an immediate effect upon Lady Stock's
      countenance; her eyebrows descended from the high arch of contempt: and
      after a pause, she remarked, "it was strange that they had not accepted of
      any of the invitations she had lately sent them&mdash;she fancied they
      were, as indeed they had the character of being, very proud people&mdash;and
      very odd."
    </p>
    <p>
      Almeria denied the pride and the oddity; but observed, "that they were all
      remarkably fond of <i>home</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear Miss Turnbull, that's what I call odd; but I am sure I have
      nothing to say against all that&mdash;it is the fashion now to let every
      body do as they please: if the Elmours like to bury themselves alive, I'm
      sure I can't have the smallest objection; I only hope they don't insist
      upon burying you along with them&mdash;I'm going to Harrowgate for a few
      days, and I must have you with me, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Our heroine hesitated. Lady Stock smiled, and said, she saw Miss Turnbull
      was terribly afraid of these Elmours; that for her part, she was the last
      person in the world to break through old connexions; but that really some
      people ought to consider that other people cannot always live as they do;
      that one style of life was fit for one style of fortune, and one for
      another; and that it would look very strange to the world, if an heiress
      with two hundred thousand pounds fortune, who if she produced herself
      might be in the first circles in town, were to be boxed up at Elmour
      Grove, and precluded from all advantages and offers that she might of
      course expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do our heroine justice, she here interrupted Lady Stock with more
      eagerness than strict politeness admitted, and positively declared that
      her friends never for one moment wished to confine her at Elmour Grove.
      "On the contrary," said she, "they urged me to go into company, and to see
      something of the world, before I&mdash;" marry, she was going to say&mdash;but
      paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Stock waited for the finishing word; but when it did not come, she
      went on just as if it had been pronounced. "The Elmours do vastly right
      and proper to talk to you in this style, for they would be very much
      blamed in the world if they acted otherwise. You know, young Elmour has
      his fortune to make&mdash;very clever certainly he is, and will rise&mdash;no
      doubt&mdash;I'm told&mdash;in his profession&mdash;but all that is not the
      same as a ready-made fortune, which an heiress like you has a right to
      expect. But do not let me annoy you with my reflections. Perhaps there is
      nothing in the report&mdash;I really only repeat what I hear every body
      say. In what every body says, you know there must be something. I
      positively think you ought to show, in justice to the Elmours themselves,
      that you are at liberty, and that they do not want to monopolize you&mdash;in
      this unaccountable sort of way."
    </p>
    <p>
      To this last argument our heroine yielded, or to this she chose to
      attribute her yielding. She went to Harrowgate with Lady Stock; and every
      day and every hour she became more desirous of appearing fashionable. To
      this one object all her thoughts were directed. Living in public was to
      her a new life, and she was continually sensible of her dependence upon
      the opinion of her more experienced companion. She felt the <i>awkwardness</i>
      of being surrounded by people with whom she was unacquainted. At first,
      whenever she appeared she imagined that every body was looking at her, or
      talking about her, and she was in perpetual apprehension that something in
      her dress or manners should become the subject of criticism or ridicule:
      but from this fear she was soon relieved, by the conviction that most
      people were so occupied with themselves as totally to overlook her.
      Sometimes indeed she heard the whispered question of "Who is that with
      Lady Stock?" and the mortifying answer, "I do not know." However, when
      Lady Stock had introduced her to some of her acquaintance as a great
      heiress, the scene changed, and she found herself treated with much <i>consideration</i>;
      though still the fashionable belles took sufficient care to make her
      sensible of her inferiority. She longed to be upon an equal footing with
      them. Whilst her mind was in this state, Sir Thomas Stock, one morning,
      when he was settling some money business with her, observed that she would
      in another year be of age, and of course would take her affairs into her
      own hands; but in the mean time it would be necessary to appoint a
      guardian; and that the choice depended upon herself. She instantly named
      her friend Mr. Elmour. Sir Thomas insinuated that old Mr. Elmour, though
      undoubtedly a most unexceptionable character, was not exactly the most
      eligible person for a guardian to a young lady, whose large fortune
      entitled her to live in a fashionable style. That if it was Miss
      Turnbull's intention to fix in the country, Mr. Elmour certainly was upon
      the spot, and a very fit guardian; but that if she meant to appear, as
      doubtless she would, in town, she would of course want another conductor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To cut the matter short at once, my dear," said Lady Stock, "you must
      come to town with me next winter, and choose Sir Thomas for your guardian.
      I'm sure it will give him the greatest pleasure in the world to do any
      thing in his power&mdash;and you will have no difficulties with him; for
      you see he is not a man to bore you with all manner of advice; in short,
      he would only be your guardian for form's sake; and that, you know, would
      be the pleasantest footing imaginable. Come, here is a pen and ink and
      gilt paper; write to old Elmour this minute, and let me have you all to
      myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Almeria was taken by surprise: she hesitated&mdash;all her former
      professions, all her obligations to the Elmour family, recurred to her
      mind&mdash;her friendship for Ellen&mdash;her love, or what she had
      thought love, for Frederick:&mdash;she could not decide upon a measure
      that might offend them, or appear ungrateful; yet her desire of going to
      town with Lady Stock was ardent, and she knew not how to refuse Sir
      Thomas's offer without displeasing him. She saw that all future connexion
      with <i>the Stocks</i> depended on her present determination&mdash;she
      took a middle course, and suggested that she might have two guardians, and
      then she should be able to avail herself of Sir Thomas's obliging offer
      without offending her old friends. In consequence of this convenient
      arrangement, she wrote to Mr. Elmour, enclosing her letter in one to
      Ellen, in which the embarrassment and weakness of her mind were evident,
      notwithstanding all her endeavours to conceal them. After a whole page of
      incomprehensible apologies, for having so long delayed to write to her
      dearest Ellen; and after professions of the warmest affection, esteem, and
      gratitude, for her friends at Elmour Grove; she in the fourth page of her
      epistle opened her real business, by declaring that she should ever, from
      the conviction she felt of the superiority of Ellen's understanding,
      follow her judgment, however repugnant it might sometimes be to her
      inclinations; that she therefore had resolved, in pursuance of Ellen's
      advice, to take an opportunity of seeing the gay world, and had accepted
      of an invitation from Lady Stock to spend the winter with her in town&mdash;that
      she had also accepted of Sir Thomas Stock's offer to become one of her
      guardians, as she thought it best to trouble her good friend Mr. Elmour as
      little as possible at his advanced age.
    </p>
    <p>
      In answer to this letter, she received a few lines from Mr. Elmour,
      requesting to see her before she should go to town: accordingly upon her
      return to York, she went to Elmour Grove to take leave of her friends. She
      was under some anxiety, but resolved to carry it off with that ease, or
      affectation of ease, which she had learnt during her six weeks'
      apprenticeship to a fine lady at Harrowgate. She was surprised that no
      Frederick appeared to greet her arrival; the servant showed her into Mr.
      Elmour's study. The good old gentleman received her with that proud sort
      of politeness, which was always the sign, and the only sign, of his being
      displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will excuse me, Miss Turnbull," said he, "for giving you the trouble
      of coming here; it was my business to have waited on you, but I have been
      so far unwell lately, that it was not in my power to leave home; and these
      are papers," continued he, "which I thought it my duty to deliver into
      your own hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Mr. Elmour was tying up these papers, and writing upon them,
      Almeria began two sentences with "I hope," and "I am afraid," without in
      the least knowing what she hoped or feared. She was not yet sufficiently
      perfect in the part of a fine lady to play it well. Mr. Elmour looked up
      from his writing with an air of grave attention when she began to speak,
      but after waiting in vain for an intelligible sentence, he proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have judged very wisely for me, Miss Turnbull, in relieving my
      declining years from the fatigue of business: no man understands the
      management or the value of money better than Sir Thomas Stock, and you
      could not, madam, in this point of view, have chosen a more proper
      guardian."
    </p>
    <p>
      Almeria said, "that she hoped Mr. Elmour would always permit her to
      consider him as her best friend, to whose advice she should have recourse
      in preference to that of any person upon earth;" recovering her assurance
      as she went on speaking, and recollecting some of the hints Lady Stock had
      given her, about the envy and jealousy of the Elmours, and of their scheme
      of monopolizing her fortune; she added a few commonplace phrases about
      respectability&mdash;gratitude&mdash;and great obligations&mdash;then gave
      a glance at Lady Stock's handsome carriage, which was waiting at the door&mdash;then
      asked for Miss Elmour&mdash;and hoped she should not be so unfortunate as
      to miss seeing her before she left the country, as she came on purpose to
      take leave of her&mdash;then looked at her watch:&mdash;but all this was
      said and done with the awkwardness of a novice in the art of giving
      herself airs. Mr. Elmour, without being in the least irritated by her
      manner, was all the time considering how he could communicate, with the
      least possible pain, what he had further to say&mdash;"You speak of me,
      Miss Turnbull, as of one of your guardians, in the letter I had the favour
      of receiving from you a few days ago," said he; "but you must excuse me
      for declining that honour. Circumstances have altered materially since I
      first undertook the management of your affairs, and my future
      interference, or perhaps even my advice, might not appear as disinterested
      as formerly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Turnbull here interrupted him with an exclamation of astonishment,
      and made many protestations of entire dependence upon his disinterested
      friendship. He waited with proud patience till she had finished her
      eulogium.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How far the generous extent of your confidence, madam, reaches, or may
      hereafter reach," said he, "must be tried by others, not by me&mdash;nor
      yet by my son."
    </p>
    <p>
      Almeria changed colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has left it to me, madam, to do that for him, which perhaps he feared
      he might not have sufficient resolution to do for himself&mdash;to return
      to you these letters and this picture; and to assure you that he considers
      you as entirely at liberty to form any connexion that may be suited to
      your present views and circumstances."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Elmour put into her hand a packet of her own letters to Frederick, and
      a miniature picture of herself, which she had formerly given to her lover.
      This was an unexpected stroke. His generosity&mdash;his firmness of
      character&mdash;the idea of losing him for ever&mdash;all rushed upon her
      mind at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Artificial manners vanish the moment the natural passions are touched.
      Almeria clasped her hands in an agony of grief, and exclaimed, "Is he
      gone? gone for ever?&mdash;I have deserved it!"&mdash;The letters and
      picture fell from her hand, and she sunk back quite overpowered. When she
      recovered, she found herself in the open air on a seat under Mr. Elmour's
      study windows, and Ellen beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pity, forgive, and advise me, my dear, my best, my only real friend,"
      said Almeria: "never did I want your advice so much as at this moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have it, then, without reserve," said Ellen, "and without fear
      that it should be attributed to any unworthy motive. I could almost as
      soon wish for my brother's death as desire to see him united to any woman,
      let her beauty and accomplishments be what they might, who had a mean or
      frivolous character, such as could consider money as the greatest good, or
      dissipation as the prime object of life. I am firmly persuaded, my dear
      Almeria, that however you may be dazzled by the first view of what is
      called fashionable life, you will soon see things as they really are, and
      that you will return to your former tastes and feelings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I am, I am returned to them!" cried Almeria; "I will write directly
      to Lady Stock and to Sir Thomas, to tell them that I have changed my mind&mdash;only
      prevail upon your father to be my guardian."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is out of my power," said Ellen; "and I think that it is much better
      you should be as you are, left completely at liberty, and entirely
      independent of us. I advise you, Almeria, to persist in your scheme of
      spending the ensuing winter in town with Lady Stock&mdash;then you will
      have an opportunity of comparing your own different feelings, and of
      determining what things are essential to your happiness. If you should
      find that the triumphs of fashion delight you more than the pleasures of
      domestic life; pursue them&mdash;your fortune will put it in your power;
      you will break no engagements; and you will have no reproaches to fear
      from us. On the contrary, if you find that your happiness depends upon
      friendship and love, and that the life we formerly led together is that
      which you prefer, you will return to Elmour Grove, to your friend and your
      lover, and your choice will not be that of romance, but of reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with difficulty that Almeria, in her present fit of enthusiasm,
      could be brought to listen to sober sense and true friendship. Her parting
      from Ellen and Mr. Elmour cost her many tears, and she returned to her
      fashionable friend with swollen eyes and a heavy heart. Her sorrow,
      however, was soon forgotten in the bustle and novelty of a new situation.
      Upon her arrival in London, fresh trains of ideas were quickly forced upon
      her mind, which were as dissimilar as possible from those associated with
      love, friendship, and Elmour Grove. At Sir Thomas Stock's, every thing she
      saw and heard served to remind, or rather to convince her, of the opulence
      of the owner of the house. Here every object was estimated, not for its
      beauty or elegance, but by its costliness. Money was the grand criterion,
      by which the worth of animate and inanimate objects was alike decided. In
      this society, the worship of the golden idol was avowed without shame or
      mystery; and all who did not bow the knee to it were considered as
      hypocrites or fools. Our heroine, possessed of two hundred thousand
      pounds, could not fail to have a large share of incense&mdash;every thing
      she said, or looked, was applauded in Sir Thomas Stock's family; and she
      would have found admiration delightful, if she had not suspected that her
      fortune alone entitled her to all this applause. This was rather a
      mortifying reflection. By degrees, however, her delicacy on this subject
      abated; she learned philosophically to consider her fortune a thing so
      immediately associated with herself as to form a part of her personal
      merit. Upon this principle, she soon became vain of her wealth, and she
      was led to overrate the consequence that riches bestow on their possessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a capital city, such numerous claimants for distinction appear, with
      beauty, birth, wit, fashion, or wealth to support their pretensions, that
      the vanity of an individual, however clamorous, is immediately silenced,
      if not humbled. When Miss Turnbull went into public, she was surprised by
      the discovery of her own, nay even of Lady Stock's insignificance. At York
      her ladyship was considered as a personage high as human veneration could
      look; but in London she was lost in a crowd of fellow-mortals.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, perhaps, from this sense of humiliation, that individuals combine
      together, to obtain by their union that importance and self-complacency,
      which separately they could never enjoy. Miss Turnbull observed, that a
      numerous acquaintance was essential to those who lived much in public&mdash;that
      the number of bows and curtsies, and the consequence of the persons by
      whom they are given or received, is the measure of merit and happiness.
      Nothing can be more melancholy than most places of public amusement, to
      those who are strangers to the crowds which fill them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few people have such strength of mind as to be indifferent to the opinions
      of numbers, even considered merely as numbers; hence those who live in
      crowds, in fact surrender the power of thinking for themselves, either in
      trifles or matters of consequence. Our heroine had imagined before she
      came to town, that Lady Stock moved in the highest circle of fashion; but
      she soon perceived that many of the people of rank who visited her
      ladyship, and who partook of her sumptuous entertainments, thought they
      condescended extremely whilst they paid this homage to wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night at the Opera, Almeria happened to be seated in the next box to
      Lady Bradstone, a proud woman of high family, who considered all whose
      genealogy could not vie in antiquity with her own as upstarts that ought
      to be kept down. Her ladyship, either not knowing or not caring who was in
      the next box to her, began to ridicule an entertainment which had been
      given a few days before by Lady Stock. From her entertainment, the
      transition was easy to her character, and to that of her whole family.
      Young Stock was pronounced to have all the purse-proud self-sufficiency of
      a banker, and all the pertness of a clerk; even his bow seemed as if it
      came from behind the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till this moment Almeria had at least permitted, if not encouraged, this
      gentleman's assiduities; for she had hitherto seen him only in company
      where he had been admired: his attentions, therefore, had been flattering
      to her vanity. But things now began to appear in quite a different light:
      she saw Mr. Stock in the point of view in which Lady Bradstone placed him;
      and felt that she might be degraded, but could not be elevated, in the
      ranks of fashion by such an admirer. She began to wish that she was not so
      intimately connected with a family which was ridiculed for want of taste,
      and whose wealth, as she now suspected, was their only ticket of
      admittance into the society of the truly elegant. In the land of fashion,
      "Alps on Alps arise;" and no sooner has the votary reached the summit of
      one weary ascent than another appears higher still and more difficult of
      attainment. Our heroine now became discontented in that situation, which
      but a few months before had been the grand object of her ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time, as Mr. Stock had not overheard Lady Bradstone's
      conversation at the Opera, and as he had a comfortably good opinion of
      himself, he was sure that he was making a rapid progress in the lady's
      favour. He had of late seldom heard her mention any of her friends at
      Elmour Grove; and he was convinced that her romantic attachment to
      Frederick must have been conquered by his own superior address. Her
      fortune was fully as agreeable to him as to his money-making father: the
      only difference between them was, that he loved to squander, and his
      father to hoard gold. Extravagance frequently produces premature avarice&mdash;young
      Mr. Stock calculated Miss Turnbull's fortune, weighed it against that of
      every other young lady within the sphere of his attractions, found the
      balance in her favour by some thousands, made his proposal in form, and
      could not recover his astonishment, when he found himself in form
      rejected. Sir Thomas and Lady Stock used all their influence in his
      favour, but in vain: they concluded that Almeria's passion for Frederick
      Elmour was the cause of this refusal; and they directed their arguments
      against the folly of marrying for love. Our heroine was at this time more
      in danger of the folly of marrying for fashion: not that she had fixed her
      fancy upon any man of fashion in particular, but she had formed an exalted
      idea of the whole species&mdash;and she regretted that Frederick was not
      in that magic circle in which all her hopes of happiness now centred. She
      wrote kind letters to Miss Elmour, but each letter was written with
      greater difficulty than the preceding; for she had lost all interest in
      the occupations which formerly were so delightful. She and Ellen had now
      few ideas in common; and her epistles dwindled into apologies for long
      silence&mdash;promises of being a better correspondent in future&mdash;reasons
      for breaking these promises&mdash;hopes of pardon, &amp;c. Ellen, however,
      continued steady in her belief that her friend would at last prove worthy
      of her esteem, and of her brother's love. The rejection of Mr. Stock,
      which Almeria did not fail to mention, confirmed this favourable opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When that gentleman was at length with some difficulty convinced that our
      heiress had decided against him, his manners and those of his family
      changed towards her from the extreme of civility to that of rudeness&mdash;they
      spoke of her as a coquette and a jilt, and a person who gave herself very
      extraordinary airs. She was vexed, and alarmed&mdash;and in her first
      confusion and distress thought of retreating to her friends at Elmour
      Grove. She wrote a folio sheet to Ellen, unlike her late apologetic
      epistles, full of the feelings of her heart, and of a warm invective
      against fashionable and interested <i>friends</i>. After a narrative of
      her quarrel with the Stocks, she declared that she would immediately quit
      her London acquaintance and return to her best friend. But the very day
      after she had despatched this letter she changed her mind, and formed a
      new idea of a <i>best friend</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning she went with Lady Stock to a bookseller's, whose shop served
      as a fashionable <i>lounge</i>. Her ladyship valued books, like all other
      things, in proportion to the money which they cost: she had no taste for
      literature, but a great fancy for accumulating the most expensive
      publications, which she displayed ostentatiously as part of the costly
      furniture of her house. Whilst she was looking over some literary
      luxuries, rich in all the elegance of hot-press and vellum binding, Lady
      Bradstone and a party of her friends came into the room. She immediately
      attracted and engrossed the attention of all present. Lady Stock turned
      over the leaves of the fine books, and asked their prices; but she had the
      mortification to perceive that she was an object rather of derision than
      of admiration to the new comers. None are so easily put out of countenance
      by airs, as those who are most apt to play them off on their inferiors.
      Lady Stock bit her lips in evident embarrassment, and the awkwardness of
      her distress increased the confidence and triumph of her adversary. She
      had some time before provoked Lady Bradstone by giving a concert in
      opposition to one of hers, and by engaging, at an enormous expense, a
      celebrated performer for <i>her night</i>: hostilities had thenceforward
      been renewed at every convenient opportunity, by the contending fair ones.
      Lady Bradstone now took occasion loudly to lament her extreme poverty; and
      she put this question to all her party, whether if they had it in their
      power they should prefer having more money than taste, or more taste than
      money? They were going to decide <i>par acclamation</i>, but her ladyship
      insisted upon taking each vote separately, because this prolonged the
      torments of her rival, who heard the preference of taste to money
      reiterated half a dozen times over, with the most provoking variety of
      insulting emphasis. Almeria's sufferings during this scene were far more
      poignant than those of the person against whom the ridicule was aimed: not
      that she pitied Lady Stock&mdash;no; she would have rejoiced to have seen
      her humbled to the dust, if she could have escaped all share in her
      mortification: but as she appeared as her ladyship's acquaintance, she
      apprehended that she might be mistaken for her friend. An opportunity
      offered of marking the difference. The bookseller asked Lady Stock if she
      chose to put her name down in a list of subscribers to a new work. The
      book, she saw, was to be dedicated to Lady Bradstone&mdash;and that was
      sufficient to decide her against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She declared that she never supported such things either by her name or
      her money; that for her part she was no politician; that she thought
      female patriots were absurd and odious; and that she was glad none of that
      description were of her acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was plainly directed against Lady Bradstone, who was a zealous
      patriot: her ladyship retorted, by some reflections equally keen, but
      rather more politely expressed, each party addressing their inuendoes to
      the bookseller, who afraid to disoblige either the rich or the
      fashionable, preserved, as much as it was in the power of his muscles, a
      perfectly neutral countenance. At last, in order to relieve himself from
      his constraint, he betook himself to count the subscribers, and Miss
      Turnbull seized this moment to desire that her name might be added to the
      list. Lady Bradstone's eyes were immediately fixed upon her with
      complacency&mdash;Lady Stock's flashed fire. Regardless of their fire,
      Almeria coolly added, "Twelve copies, sir, if you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twelve copies, Miss Turnbull, at a guinea a-piece! Lord bless me, do you
      know what you are about, my dear?" said Lady Stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly well," replied our heroine; "I think twelve guineas, or twenty
      times that sum, would be well bestowed in asserting independence of
      sentiment, which I understand is the object of this work."
    </p>
    <p>
      A whisper from Lady Bradstone to one of the shopmen, of "Who is that
      charming woman?" gave our heroine courage to pronounce these words. Lady
      Stock in great displeasure walked to her carriage, saying, "You are to
      consider what you will do with your twelve copies, Miss Turnbull; for I am
      convinced your guardian will never let such a parcel of inflammatory trash
      into his house: he admires female patriotism, and <i>all that sort of
      thing</i>, as little as I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      The rudeness of this speech did not disconcert Almeria; for she was
      fortified by the consciousness that she had gained her point with Lady
      Bradstone. This lady piqued herself upon showing her preferences and
      aversions with equal enthusiasm and <i>éclat</i>. She declared before a
      large company at dinner, that notwithstanding Miss Turnbull was <i>nobody</i>
      by birth, she had made herself <i>somebody</i> by spirit; and that for her
      part, she should, contrary to her general principle, which she confessed
      was to keep a strong line of demarcation between nobility and mobility,
      take a pride in bringing forward merit even in the shape of a Yorkshire
      grazier's daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pursuant to this gracious declaration, she empowered a common friend to
      introduce Miss Turnbull to her, on the first opportunity. When people
      really wish to become acquainted with each other, opportunities are easily
      and quickly found. The parties met, to their mutual satisfaction, that
      very night in the waiting-room of the Opera-house, and conversed more in
      five minutes than people in town usually converse in five months or years,
      when it is their wish to keep on a merely civil footing. But this was not
      the footing on which Miss Turnbull desired to be with Lady Bradstone; she
      took the utmost pains to please, and succeeded. She owed her success
      chiefly to the dexterous manner in which she manifested her contempt for
      her late dear friend Lady Stock. Her having refused an alliance with the
      family was much in her favour; her ladyship admired her spirit, but little
      suspected that the contemptuous manner in which she had once been
      overheard to speak of this <i>banker's son</i> was the real and immediate
      cause of his rejection. The phrase&mdash;"<i>only</i> Stock the banker's
      son"&mdash;decided his fate: so much may be done by the mere emphasis on a
      single word from fashionable lips! Our heroine managed with considerable
      address in bringing her quarrel with one friend to a crisis at the moment
      when another was ready to receive her. An ostensible pretext is never
      wanting to those who are resolved on war. The book to which Miss Turnbull
      had subscribed was the pretext upon this occasion: nothing could be more
      indifferent to her than politics; but Lady Bradstone's party and
      principles were to be defended at all events. Sir Thomas Stock protested
      that he might be hurt essentially in the opinion of those for whom he had
      the highest consideration if a young lady living under his roof, known to
      be his ward, and probably presumed to be guided by him, should put her
      name as subscriber to twelve copies of a work patronized by Lady
      Bradstone. "The mere circumstance of its being dedicated to her ladyship
      showed what it <i>must</i> be," Sir Thomas observed; and he made it a
      point with Miss Turnbull that she should withdraw her name from the
      subscription. This Miss Turnbull absolutely refused. Lady Bradstone was
      her confidante upon the occasion, and half-a-dozen notes a day passed
      between them: at length the affair was brought to the long wished-for
      crisis. Lady Bradstone invited Miss Turnbull to her house, feeling
      herself, as she said, bound in honour to <i>bear her out</i> in a dispute
      of which she had been the original occasion. In this lady's society
      Almeria found the style of dress, manners, and conversation, different
      from what she had seen at Lady Stock's: she had without difficulty
      imitated the affectation of Lady Stock, but there was an ease in the
      decided tone of Lady Bradstone which could not be so easily acquired.
      Having lived from her infancy in the best company, there was no
      heterogeneous mixture in her manners; and the consciousness of this gave
      an habitual air of security to her words, looks, and motions. Lady Stock
      seemed forced to beg or buy&mdash;Lady Bradstone accustomed to command or
      levy admiration as her rightful tribute. The pride of Lady Bradstone was
      uniformly resolute, and successful; the insolence of Lady Stock, if it
      were opposed, became cowardly and ridiculous. Lady Bradstone seemed to
      have, on all occasions, an instinctive sense of what a person of fashion
      ought to do; Lady Stock, notwithstanding her bravadoing air, was
      frequently perplexed, and anxious, and therefore awkward: she had always
      recourse to precedents. "Lady P&mdash;&mdash; said so, or Lady Q&mdash;&mdash;
      did so; Lady G&mdash;&mdash; wore this, or Lady H&mdash;&mdash; was there,
      and therefore I am sure it is proper."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the contrary, Lady Bradstone never quoted authorities, but presumed
      that she was a precedent for others. The one was eager to follow, the
      other determined to lead, the fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our heroine, who was by no means deficient in penetration, and whose whole
      attention was now given to the study of externals, quickly perceived these
      shades of difference between her late and her present friend. She
      remarked, in particular, that she found herself much more at ease in Lady
      Bradstone's society. Her ladyship's pride was not so offensive as Lady
      Stock's vanity: secure of her own superiority, Lady Bradstone did not want
      to measure herself every instant with inferiors. She treated Almeria as
      her equal in every respect; and in setting her right in points of fashion
      never seemed to triumph, but to consider her own knowledge as a necessary
      consequence of the life she had led from her infancy. With a sort of proud
      generosity, she always considered those whom she honoured with her
      friendship as thenceforward entitled to all the advantages of her own
      situation, and to all the respect due to a part of herself. She now always
      used the word <i>we</i>, with peculiar emphasis, in speaking of Miss
      Turnbull and herself. This was a signal perfectly well understood by her
      acquaintance. Almeria was received every where with the most distinguished
      attention; and she was delighted, and absolutely intoxicated, with her
      sudden rise in the world of fashion. She found that her former
      acquaintance at Lady Stock's were extremely ambitious of claiming an
      intimacy; but this could not be done. Miss Turnbull had now acquired, by
      practice, the power of looking at people without seeming to see them, and
      of forgetting those with whom she was perfectly well acquainted. Her
      opinion of her own consequence was much raised by the court that was paid
      to her by several young men of fashion, who thought it expedient to marry
      two hundred thousand pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      How quickly ambition extends her views! Our heroine's highest object had
      lately been to form an alliance with a man of fashion; she had now three
      fashionable admirers in her train, but though she was flattered by their
      attention, she had not the least inclination to decide in favour of any of
      these candidates. The only young man of her present acquaintance who
      seemed to be out of the reach of her power was Lord Bradstone; and upon
      the conquest of his heart, or rather his pride, her fancy was fixed. He
      had all his mother's family pride, and he had been taught by her to expect
      an alliance with a daughter of one of the first noble families in England.
      The possibility of his marrying a grazier's daughter had never entered
      into his or Lady Bradstone's thoughts: they saw, indeed, every day,
      examples, among the first nobility, of such matches; but they saw them
      with contempt. Almeria knew this, and yet she did not despair of success:
      nor was she wrong in her calculations. Lord Bradstone was fond of high
      play&mdash;his taste for gaming soon reduced him to distress&mdash;his
      guardian was enraged, and absolutely refused to pay his lordship's debts.
      What was to be done?&mdash;He must extricate himself from his difficulties
      by marrying some rich heiress. Miss Turnbull was the heiress nearest at
      hand. Lord Bradstone's pride was compelled to yield to his interest, and
      he resolved to pay his addresses to the Yorkshire grazier's daughter: but
      he knew that his mother would be indignant at this idea; and he therefore
      determined to proceed cautiously, and to assure himself of the young
      lady's approbation before he should brave his mother's anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter was now passed, and her ladyship invited Miss Turnbull to
      accompany her to Cheltenham;&mdash;her son was of the party. Our heroine
      plainly understood his intentions, and her friendship for Lady Bradstone
      did not prevent her from favouring his views: neither was she deterred by
      her knowledge of his lordship's taste for play, so ardent was her desire
      for a coronet. The recollection of Frederick Elmour sometimes crossed her
      imagination, and struck her heart; but the pang was soon over, and she
      settled her conscience by the reflection, that she was not, in the least
      degree, bound in honour to him&mdash;he had set her entirely at liberty,
      and could not complain of her conduct. As to Ellen&mdash;every day she
      determined to write to her, and every day she put it off till to-morrow.
      At last she was saved the trouble of making and breaking any more
      resolutions: for one evening, as she was walking with Lady Bradstone and
      her noble admirer, in the public walk, she met Miss Elmour and her
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      She accosted Ellen with great eagerness; but it was plain to her friend's
      discerning eyes that her joy was affected. After repeating several times
      that she was quite delighted at this unexpected meeting, she ran on with a
      number of commonplace questions, commencing and concluding with, "When did
      you come?&mdash;How long do you stay?&mdash;Where do you lodge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have been here about a fortnight, and I believe we shall stay about a
      month longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!&mdash;A month!&mdash;So long!&mdash;How fortunate!&mdash;But
      where are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We lodge a little out of the town, on the road to Cirencester."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How unfortunate!&mdash;We are at such a shocking distance!&mdash;I'm with
      Lady Bradstone&mdash;a most charming woman!&mdash;Whom are you with?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With my poor father," said Ellen; "he has been very ill lately, and we
      came here on his account."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ill!&mdash;Old Mr. Elmour!&mdash;I'm extremely concerned&mdash;but whom
      have you to attend him?&mdash;you should send to town for Dr. Grant&mdash;do
      you know he is the only man now?&mdash;the only man Lady Bradstone and I
      have any dependence on&mdash;if I were dying, he is the man I should send
      for. Do have him for Mr. Elmour, my dear&mdash;and don't be alarmed, above
      all things&mdash;you know it's so natural, at your father's age, that he
      should not be as well as he has been&mdash;but I distress you&mdash;and
      detain you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Our heroine, after running off these unmeaning sentences, passed on, being
      ashamed to walk with Ellen in public, because Lady Bradstone had
      whispered, "<i>Who is she?</i>"&mdash;Not to be known in the world of
      fashion is an unpardonable crime, for which no merit can atone. Three days
      elapsed before Miss Turnbull went to see her friends, notwithstanding her
      extreme concern for poor Mr. Elmour. Her excuse to her conscience was,
      that Lady Bradstone's carriage could not sooner be spared. People in a
      certain rank of life are, or make themselves, slaves to horses and
      carriages; with every apparent convenience and luxury, they are frequently
      more dependent than their tradesmen or their servants. There was a time
      when Almeria would not have been restrained by these imaginary <i>impossibilities</i>
      from showing kindness to her friends; but that time was now completely
      past. She was, at present, anxious to avoid having any private
      conversation with Ellen, because she was ashamed to avow her change of
      views and sentiments. In the short morning visit which she paid her,
      Almeria talked of public places, of public characters, of dress and
      equipages, &amp;c. She inquired, indeed, with a modish air of infinite
      sensibility, for poor Mr. Elmour; and when she heard that he was confined
      to his bed, she regretted most excessively that she could not see him; but
      a few seconds afterwards, with a suitable change of voice and countenance,
      she made an easy transition to the praise of a new dress of Lady
      Bradstone's invention. Frederick Elmour came into the room in the midst of
      the eulogium on her ladyship's taste&mdash;she was embarrassed for a
      moment; but quickly recovering the tone of a fine lady, she spoke to him
      as if he had never been any thing to her but a common acquaintance. The
      dignity and firmness of his manner provoked her pride; she wished to
      coquet with him&mdash;she tried to excite his jealousy by talking of Lord
      Bradstone: but vain were all her airs and inuendoes; they could not extort
      from him even a sigh. She was somewhat consoled, however, by observing in
      his sister's countenance the expression, as she thought, of extreme
      mortification.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after this visit, Miss Turnbull received the following note
      from Miss Elmour:
    </p>
    <p>
      "MY DEAR ALMERIA,
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you still wish that I should treat you as a friend, show me that you
      do, and you will find my affection unaltered. If, on the contrary, you
      have decided to pursue a mode of life, or to form connexions which make
      you ashamed to own any one for a friend who is not a fine lady, let our
      intimacy be dissolved for ever&mdash;it could only be a source of mutual
      pain. My father is better to-day, and wishes to see you. Will you spend
      this evening with him and with Your affectionate ELLEN ELMOUR?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that the very day Miss Turnbull received this note, Lady
      Bradstone was to have a concert, and Almeria knew that her ladyship would
      be offended if she were to spend the evening with the Elmours: it was, as
      she said to herself, <i>impossible</i>, therefore, to accept of Ellen's
      invitation. She called upon her in the course of the morning, to make an
      apology. She found Ellen beside her father, who was seated in his
      arm-chair: he looked extremely pale and weak: she was at first shocked at
      the change she saw in her old friend, and she could not utter the
      premeditated apology. Ellen took it for granted that she was come, in
      consequence of her note, to spend the day with her, and she embraced her
      with affectionate joy. Her whole countenance changed when our heroine
      began at last to talk of Lady Bradstone and the concert&mdash;Ellen burst
      into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear child," said Mr. Elmour, putting his hand upon his daughter's,
      which rested upon the arm of his chair, "I did not expect this weakness
      from you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Turnbull, impatient to shorten a scene which she had neither strength
      of mind to endure nor to prevent, rose to take leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Ellen," said she, in an irresolute tone, "my dearest creature,
      you must not distress yourself in this way&mdash;I must have you keep up
      your spirits. You confine yourself too much, indeed you do; and you see
      you are not equal to it. Your father will be better, and he will persuade
      you to leave him for an hour or two, I am sure, and we must have you
      amongst us; and I must introduce you to Lady Bradstone&mdash;she's a
      charming woman, I assure you&mdash;you would like her of all things, if
      you knew her. Come&mdash;don't let me see you in this way. Really, my dear
      Ellen, this is so unlike you&mdash;I can assure you that, whatever you may
      think, I love you as well as ever I did, and never shall forget my
      obligations to <i>all</i> your family; but, you know, a person who lives
      in the world, as I do, must make such terrible sacrifices of their time&mdash;one
      can't do as one pleases&mdash;one's an absolute slave. So you must forgive
      me, dear Ellen, for bidding you farewell for the present."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen hastily wiped away her tears, and turning to Almeria with an air of
      dignity, held out her hand to her, and said, "Farewell for ever, Almeria!&mdash;May
      you never feel the want of a sincere and affectionate friend!&mdash;May
      the triumphs of fashion make you amends for all you sacrifice to obtain
      them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Turnbull was abashed and agitated&mdash;she hurried out of the room
      to conceal her confusion, stepped into a carriage with a coronet, drove
      away, and endeavoured to forget all that had passed. The concert in the
      evening recalled her usual train of ideas, and she persuaded herself that
      she had done all, and more than was necessary, in offering to introduce
      Ellen to Lady Bradstone. "How could she neglect such an offer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after the concert, Almeria had the pleasure of being introduced
      to Lady Bradstone's four daughters&mdash;Lady Gabriella, Lady Agnes, Lady
      Bab, and Lady Kitty. Of the existence of these young ladies Almeria had
      scarcely heard&mdash;they had been educated at a fashionable
      boarding-school; and their mother was now under the disagreeable necessity
      of bringing them home to live with her, because the eldest was past
      seventeen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Gabriella was a beauty, and determined to be a Grace&mdash;but which
      of the three Graces, she had not yet decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Agnes was plain, and resolved to be a wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Bab and Lady Kitty were charming hoydens, with all the <i>modern</i>
      simplicity of fourteen or fifteen in their manners. Lady Bab had a fine
      long neck, which was always in motion&mdash;Lady Kitty had white teeth,
      and was always laughing;&mdash;but it is impossible to characterize them,
      for they differed in nothing from a thousand other young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      These four sisters agreed in but one point&mdash;in considering their
      mother as their common enemy. Taking it for granted that Miss Turnbull was
      her friend, she was looked upon by them as being naturally entitled to a
      share of their distrust and enmity. They found a variety of causes of
      complaint against our heroine; and if they had been at any loss, their
      respective waiting-maids would have furnished them with inexhaustible
      causes of quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Bradstone could not bear to go with more than four in a coach.&mdash;"Why
      was Miss Turnbull always to have a front seat in the coach, and two of the
      young ladies to be always left at home on her account?"&mdash;"How could
      Lady Bradstone make such a favourite of a grazier's daughter, and prefer
      her to her own children as a companion?" &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young ladies never discouraged their attendants from saying all the
      ill-natured things that they could devise of Miss Turnbull, and they
      invented a variety of methods of tormenting her. Lady Gabriella found out
      that Almeria was horridly ugly and awkward; Lady Agnes <i>quizzed</i> her
      perpetually; and the Ladies Bab and Kitty played upon her innumerable
      practical jokes. She was astonished to find in high life a degree of
      vulgarity of which her country companions would have been ashamed: but all
      such things in high life go under the general term <i>dashing</i>. These
      young ladies were <i>dashers</i>. Alas! perhaps foreigners and future
      generations may not know the meaning of the term!
    </p>
    <p>
      Our heroine's temper was not proof against the trials to which it was
      hourly exposed: perhaps the consciousness that she was not born to the
      situation in which she now moved, joined to her extreme anxiety to be
      thought genteel and fashionable, rendered her peculiarly irritable when
      her person and manners were attacked by ladies of quality. She endeavoured
      to conciliate her young enemies by every means in her power, and at length
      she found a method of pleasing them. They were immoderately fond of
      baubles, and they had not money enough to gratify this taste. Miss
      Turnbull at first, with great timidity, begged Lady Gabriella's acceptance
      of a ring, which seemed particularly to catch her fancy: the facility with
      which the ring was accepted, and the favourable change it produced, as if
      by magic, in her ladyship's manners towards our heroine, encouraged her to
      try similar experiments upon the other sisters. She spared not ear-rings,
      crosses, brooches, pins, and necklaces; and the young ladies in return
      began to show her all the friendship which can be purchased by such
      presents&mdash;or by any presents. Even whilst she rejoiced at the change
      in their behaviour, she could not avoid despising them for the cause to
      which she knew it must be attributed; nor did she long enjoy even the
      temporary calm procured by these peace-offerings; for the very same things
      which propitiated the daughters offended the mother. Lady Bradstone one
      morning insisted upon Lady Gabriella's returning a necklace, which she had
      received from Almeria; and her ladyship informed Miss Turnbull, at the
      same time, with an air of supreme haughtiness, that "she could not
      possibly permit <i>her</i> daughters to accept such valuable presents from
      any but their own relations; that if the Lady Bradstones did not know what
      became them, it was her duty to teach them propriety."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rather late in life to begin to teach, even if they had been
      inclined to learn. They resented her last lesson, or rather her last act
      of authority, with acrimony proportioned to the value of the object; and
      Miss Turnbull was compelled to hear their complaints. Lady Gabriella said,
      she was convinced that her mother's only reason for making her return the
      necklace was because she had not one quite so handsome. Lady Agnes,
      between whom and her mamma there was pending a dispute about a pair of
      diamond ear-rings, left by her grandmother, observed, that her mother
      might, if she pleased, call <i>jealousy, propriety</i>; but that she must
      not be surprised if other people used the old vocabulary; that her mamma's
      pride and vanity were always at war; for that though she was proud enough
      to see her daughters <i>show well</i> in public, yet she required to have
      it said that she looked younger than any of them, and that she was
      infinitely better dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Bab and Lady Kitty did not fail in this favourable moment of general
      discontent to bring forward their list of grievances; and in the
      discussion of their rights and wrongs they continually appealed to our
      heroine, crowding round her whilst she stood silent and embarrassed.
      Ashamed of them and of herself, she compared the Lady Bradstones with
      Ellen&mdash;she compared the sisters-in-law she was soon to have with the
      friend she had forsaken. The young ladies mistook the expression of
      melancholy in Almeria's countenance at this instant, for sympathy in their
      sorrows; and her silence, for acquiescence in the justice of their
      complaints. They were reiterating their opinions with something like
      plebeian loudness of voice, when their mother entered the room. The ease
      with which her daughters changed their countenances and the subject of
      conversation, when she entered, might have prevented all suspicion but for
      the blushes of Almeria, who, though of all the party she was the least
      guilty, looked by far the most abashed. The necklace which hung from her
      hand, and on which in the midst of her embarrassment her eyes
      involuntarily fell, seemed to Lady Bradstone proof positive against her.
      Her ladyship recollected certain words she had heard as she opened the
      door, and now applied them without hesitation to herself. Politeness
      restrained the expression of her anger towards Miss Turnbull, but it burst
      furiously forth upon her daughters; and our heroine was now as much
      alarmed by the violence of her future mother-in-law as she had been
      disgusted by the meanness of her <i>intended</i> sisters. From this day
      forward, Lady Bradstone's manner changed towards Almeria, who could
      plainly perceive, by her altered eye, that she had lost her confidence,
      and that her ladyship considered her as one who was playing a double part,
      and fomenting dissensions in her family. She thought herself bound, in
      honour to the daughters, not to make any explanation that could throw the
      blame upon them; and she bore in painful silence the many oblique
      reproaches, reflections upon ingratitude, dissimulation, and treachery,
      which she knew were aimed at her. The consciousness that she was treating
      Lady Bradstone with insincerity, in encouraging the addresses of her son,
      increased Miss Turnbull's embarrassment; she repented having for a moment
      encouraged his clandestine attachment; and she now urged him in the
      strongest manner to impart his intentions to his mother. He assured her
      that she should be obeyed; but his obedience was put off from day to day;
      and, in the mean time, the more Almeria saw of his family, the more her
      desire to be connected with them diminished. The affair of the necklace
      was continually renewed, in some shape or other, and a perpetual
      succession of petty disputes occurred, in which both parties were in the
      wrong, and each openly or secretly blamed her for not taking their part.
      Her mind was so much harassed, that all her natural cheerfulness forsook
      her; and the being obliged to assume spirits in company, and among people
      who were not worth the toil of pleasing, became every hour more irksome.
      The transition from these domestic miseries to public dissipation and
      gaieties made her still more melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she calmly examined her own heart, she perceived that she felt little
      or no affection for Lord Bradstone, though she had been flattered by his
      attentions, when the assiduity of a man of rank and fashion was new to
      her; but now the joys of being a countess began to fade in her
      imagination. She hesitated&mdash;she had not strength of mind sufficient
      to decide&mdash;she was afraid to proceed; yet she had not courage to
      retract.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen's parting words recurred to her mind&mdash;"May you never feel the
      want of a sincere and affectionate friend! May the triumphs of fashion
      make you amends for all you sacrifice to obtain them!"&mdash;"Alas!"
      thought she, "Ellen foresaw that I should soon be disgusted with this
      joyless, heartless intercourse; but how can I recede? how can I disengage
      myself from this Lord Bradstone, now that I have encouraged his addresses?&mdash;Fool
      that I have been!&mdash;Oh! if I could now be advised by that best of
      friends, who used to assist me in all my difficulties!&mdash;But she
      despises, she has renounced me&mdash;she has bid me farewell for ever!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding this "farewell for ever," there was still at the bottom of
      Almeria's heart, even whilst she bewailed herself in this manner, a secret
      hope that Ellen's esteem and friendship might be recovered, and she
      resolved to make the trial. She was eager to put this idea into execution
      the moment it occurred to her; and after apologizing to the Lady
      Bradstones for not, as usual, accompanying them in their morning ride, she
      set out to walk to Miss Elmour's lodgings. It was a hot day&mdash;she
      walked fast from the hurry and impatience of her mind. The servant who
      attended her knocked twice at Mr. Elmour's door before any one answered;
      at last the door was opened by a maid-servant, with a broom in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Miss Elmour at home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, she left Cheltenham this morning betimes, and we be getting the
      house ready for other lodgers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Almeria was very much disappointed&mdash;she looked flushed and fatigued;
      and the maid said, "Ma'am, if you'll be pleased to rest a while, you're
      welcome, I'm sure&mdash;and the parlour's cleaned out&mdash;be pleased to
      sit down, ma'am."&mdash;Almeria followed, for she was really tired, and
      glad to accept the good-natured offer. She was shown into the same parlour
      where she had but a few weeks before taken leave of Ellen. The maid rolled
      forward the great arm-chair, in which old Mr. Elmour had been seated; and
      as she moved it, a gold-headed cane fell to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almeria's eyes turned upon it directly as it fell; for it was an old
      friend of hers: many a time she had played with it when she was a child,
      and for many years she had been accustomed to see it in the hand of a man
      whom she loved and respected. It brought many pleasing and some painful
      associations to her mind&mdash;for she reflected how ill she had behaved
      to the owner of it the last time she saw him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, ma'am," said the maid, "it is the poor old gentleman's cane, sure
      enough&mdash;it has never been stirred from here, nor his hat and gloves,
      see, since the day he died."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Died!&mdash;Good Heavens!&mdash;Is Mr. Elmour dead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sure&mdash;he died last Tuesday, and was buried yesterday. You'd
      better drink some of this water, ma'am," said the girl, filling a glass
      that stood on the table. "Why! dear heart! I would not have mentioned it
      so sudden in this way, but I thought it could no way hurt you. Why, it
      never came into my head you could be a friend of the family's, nor more,
      may be, at the utmost, than an acquaintance, as you never used to call
      much during his illness."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the most cutting reproach, and the innocence with which it was
      uttered made it still more severe. Almeria burst into tears; and the poor
      girl, not knowing what to say next, and sorry for all she had said, took
      up the cane, which had fallen from Almeria's hands, and applied herself to
      brightening the gold head with great diligence. At this instant there was
      a double knock at the house-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's only the young gentleman, ma'am," said the maid, as she went towards
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What young gentleman?" said Almeria, rising from her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young Mr. Elmour, ma'am: he did not go away with his sister, but stayed
      to settle some matters. Oh, they have let him in!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid stood with the parlour-door half open in her hand, not being able
      to decide in her own fancy whether the lady wished that he should come
      into the room or stay out; and before either she, or perhaps Almeria, had
      decided this point, it was settled for them by his walking in. Almeria was
      standing so as to be hid by the door; and he was so intent upon his own
      thoughts, that, without perceiving there was any body in the room, he
      walked straight forward to the table, took up his father's hat and gloves,
      and gave a deep sigh. He heard his sigh echoed&mdash;looked up, and
      started at the sight of Almeria, but immediately assumed an air of distant
      and cold respect. He was in deep mourning, and looked pale, as if he had
      suffered much. Almeria endeavoured to speak; but could get out only a few
      words, expressive of <i>the shock and astonishment</i> she had just felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Undoubtedly, madam, you must have been shocked," replied Frederick, in a
      calm voice; "but you could not have reason to be much astonished. My
      father's life had been despaired of some time&mdash;you must have seen how
      much he was changed when you were here a few weeks ago." Almeria could
      make no reply; the tears, in spite of all her efforts to restrain them,
      rolled down her cheeks: the cold, and almost severe, manner, in which
      Frederick spoke, and the consciousness that she deserved it, struck her to
      the heart. He followed her, as she abruptly quitted the room, and in a
      tone of more kindness, but with the same distant manner, begged to have
      the honour of attending her home. She bowed her head, to give that assent
      which her voice could not at this instant utter; and she was involuntarily
      going to put her arm within his; but, as he did not seem to perceive this
      motion, she desisted, coloured violently, adjusted the drapery of her gown
      to give employment to the neglected hand, then walked on with
      precipitation. Her foot slipped as she was crossing the street; Frederick
      offered his arm&mdash;she could not guess, from the way in which it was
      presented, whether her former attempt had been perceived or not. This
      trifle appeared to her a point of the utmost importance; for by this she
      thought she could decide whether his feelings were really as cold towards
      her as they appeared, whether he felt love and anger, or contempt and
      indifference. Whilst she was endeavouring in vain to form her opinion, all
      the time she leant upon his arm, and walked on in silence, a carriage
      passed them; Frederick bowed, and his countenance was suddenly
      illuminated. Almeria turned eagerly to see the cause of the change, and as
      the carriage drove on she caught a glimpse of a beautiful young lady. A
      spasm of jealousy seized her heart&mdash;she withdrew her arm from
      Frederick's. The abruptness of the action did not create any emotion in
      him&mdash;his thoughts were absent. In a few minutes he slackened his
      pace, and turned from the road towards a path across the fields, asking if
      Miss Turnbull had any objection to going that way to Lady Bradstone's
      instead of along the dusty road. She made no objection&mdash;she thought
      she perceived that Frederick was preparing to say something of importance
      to her, and her heart beat violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Turnbull will not, I hope, think what I am going to say impertinent;
      she may be assured that it proceeds from no motive but the desire to
      prevent the future unhappiness of one who once honoured my family with her
      friendship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are too good&mdash;I do not deserve that you should be interested in
      my happiness or unhappiness&mdash;I cannot think you impertinent&mdash;pray
      speak freely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And quickly," she would have added, if she dared. Without abating any of
      his reserve from this encouragement, he proceeded precisely in the same
      tone as before, and with the same steady composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An accidental acquaintance with a friend of my Lord Bradstone's, has put
      me in possession of what, perhaps, you wish to be a secret, madam, and
      what I shall inviolably keep as such."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot pretend to be ignorant of what you allude to," said Almeria;
      "but it is more than probable that you may not have heard the exact state
      of the business; indeed it is impossible that you should, because no one
      but myself could fully explain my sentiments. In fact they were undecided;
      I was this very morning going to consult your sister upon that subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not suppose that I am going to intrude my counsels upon you,
      Miss Turnbull; nothing can be farther from my intention: I am merely going
      to mention a fact to you, of which I apprehend you are ignorant, and of
      which, as you are circumstanced, no one in your present society, perhaps
      no one in the world but myself, would choose to apprize you. Forgive me,
      madam, if I try your patience by this preface: I am very desirous not to
      wound your feelings more than is necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," said Almeria, with a doubtful smile, "perhaps you are under a
      mistake, and imagine my feelings to be much more interested than they
      really are. If you have any thing to communicate to Lord Bradstone's
      disadvantage, you may mention it to me without hesitation, and without
      fear of injuring my happiness or his; for, to put you at ease at once, I
      am come to a determination positively to decline his lordship's
      addresses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This assurance certainly puts me at ease at once," said Frederick. But
      Almeria observed that he neither expressed by his voice nor countenance
      any of that joy which she had hoped to inspire by the assurance: on the
      contrary, he heard it as a determination in which he was personally
      unconcerned, and in which pure benevolence alone could give him an
      interest. "This relieves me," continued he, "from all necessity of
      explaining myself further."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay," said Almeria, "but I must beg you will explain yourself. You do not
      know but it may be necessary for me to have your antidote ready in case of
      a relapse."
    </p>
    <p>
      No change, at least none that betrayed the anxiety of a lover, was visible
      in Frederick's countenance at this hint of a relapse; but he gravely
      answered, that, when so urged, he could not forbear to tell her the exact
      truth, that Lord Bradstone was a ruined man&mdash;ruined by gaming&mdash;and
      that he had been so indelicate as to declare to his <i>friend</i>, that
      his sole object in marrying was money. Our heroine's pride was severely
      hurt by the last part of this information; but even that did not wound her
      so keenly as the manner in which Frederick behaved. She saw that he had no
      remains of affection for her lurking in his heart&mdash;she saw that he
      now acted merely as he declared, from a desire to save from misery one who
      had formerly honoured his family with her friendship. Stiff, cold words&mdash;she
      endeavoured to talk upon indifferent subjects, but could not&mdash;she was
      somewhat relieved when they reached Lady Bradstone's door, and when
      Frederick left her. The moment he was gone, however, she ran up stairs to
      her own apartment, and looked eagerly out of her window to catch the last
      glimpse of him. Such is the strange caprice of the human heart, that a
      lover appears the most valuable at the moment he is lost. Our heroine had
      felt all her affection for Frederick revive with more than its former
      force within this last hour; and she thought she now loved with a degree
      of passion of which she had never before found herself capable. Hope is
      perhaps inseparable from the existence of the passion of love. She passed
      alternately from despair to the most flattering delusions: she fancied
      that Frederick's coldness was affected&mdash;that he was acting only from
      honour&mdash;that he wished to leave her at liberty&mdash;and that as soon
      as he knew she was actually disengaged from Lord Bradstone, he would fly
      to her with all his former eagerness. This notion having once taken
      possession of her mind, she was impatient in the extreme to settle her
      affairs with Lord Bradstone. He was not at home&mdash;he did not come in
      till late in the evening. It happened, that the next day Almeria was to be
      of age; and Lord Bradstone, when he met her in the evening, reminded her
      of her promise not "to prolong the torments of suspense beyond that
      period." She asked whether he had, in compliance with her request,
      communicated the affair to Lady Bradstone? No; but he would as soon as he
      had reasonable grounds of hope. Miss Turnbull rejoiced that he had
      disobeyed her injunctions&mdash;she said that Lady Bradstone might now be
      for ever spared hearing what would have inevitably excited her
      indignation. His lordship stared, and could not comprehend our heroine's
      present meaning. She soon made it intelligible. We forbear to relate all
      that was said upon the occasion: as it was a disappointment of the purse
      and not of the heart, his lordship was of course obliged to make a
      proportional quantity of professions of eternal sorrow and
      disinterestedness. Almeria, partly to save her own pride the mortification
      of the repetition, forbore to allude to the confidential speech in which
      he had explained to <i>a friend</i> his motives for marrying; she hoped
      that he would soon console himself with some richer heiress, and she
      rejoiced to be disencumbered of him, and even of his coronet; for in this
      moment coronets seemed to her but paltry things&mdash;so much does the
      appearance of objects vary according to the medium through which they are
      viewed!
    </p>
    <p>
      Better satisfied with herself after this refusal of the earl, and in
      better spirits than she had been for some months, she flattered herself
      with the hopes that Frederick would call upon her again before he left
      Cheltenham; he would then know that Lord Bradstone was no longer her
      lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell asleep full of these imaginations&mdash;dreamed of Frederick and
      Elmour Grove&mdash;but this was only a dream. The next day&mdash;and the
      next&mdash;and the next&mdash;passed without her seeing or hearing any
      thing of Frederick; and the fourth day, as she rode by the house where the
      Elmours had lodged, she saw put up in the parlour window an advertisement
      of "<i>Lodgings to be let</i>." She was now convinced that Frederick had
      left Cheltenham&mdash;left it without thinking of her or of Lord
      Bradstone. The young Lady Bradstones observed that she scarcely spoke a
      word during the remainder of her morning's ride. At night she was attacked
      with a feverish complaint: the image of the beautiful person whom she had
      seen in the coach that passed while she was walking with Frederick, was
      now continually before her eyes. She had made all the inquiries she could,
      to find out who that young lady might be; but this point could not be
      ascertained, because, though she described the lady accurately, she was
      not equally exact about the description of the carriage. The arms and
      livery had totally escaped her observation. The different conjectures that
      had been made by the various people to whom she had applied, and the
      voices in which their answers were given, ran in her head all this
      feverish night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps it was Lady Susanna Quin&mdash;very likely it was Lady Mary
      Lowther&mdash;very possibly Miss Grant; you know she goes about with old
      Mrs. Grant in a yellow coach&mdash;but there are so many yellow coaches&mdash;the
      arms or the livery would settle the point at once." These words, <i>the
      arms and the livery would settle the point at once,</i> she repeated to
      herself perpetually, though without annexing any ideas to the words. In
      short, she was very feverish all night; and in the morning, though she
      endeavoured to rise, she was obliged to lie down again. She was confined
      to her bed for about a week: Lady Bradstone sent for the best physicians;
      and the young ladies, in the intervals of dressing and going out, whenever
      they could remember it, came into Miss Turnbull's room to "hope she found
      herself better." It was obvious to her that no one person in the house
      cared a straw about her, and she was oppressed with the sense of being an
      encumbrance to the whole family. Whilst she was alone she formed many
      projects for her future life, which she resolved to execute as soon as she
      should recover. She determined immediately to go down to her own house in
      the country, and to write to Ellen a recantation of all her fine lady
      errors. She composed, whilst she lay on her feverish pillow, twenty
      letters to her former friend, each of them more eloquent and magnanimous
      than the other: but in proportion as her fever left her, the activity of
      her imagination abated, and with it her eloquence and magnanimity. Her
      mind, naturally weak, and now enfeebled by disease, became quite passive,
      and received and yielded to the impressions made by external
      circumstances. New trains of ideas, perfectly different from those which
      had occupied her mind during her fever, and in the days preceding her
      illness, were excited during her convalescence. She lay listening to, or
      rather hearing, the conversation of the young Lady Bradstones. They used
      to come into her room at night, and stay for some time whilst they had
      their hair curled, and talked over the events of the day&mdash;whom they
      had met&mdash;what dresses they had worn&mdash;what matches were on the
      tapis, &amp;c. They happened one night to amuse themselves with reading an
      old newspaper, in which they came to an account of a splendid masquerade,
      which had been given the preceding winter in London by a rich heiress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord! what charming entertainments Miss Turnbull might give if she
      pleased. Why, do you know, she is richer than this woman," whispered Lady
      Bab; "and she is of age now, you know. If I were she, I'm sure I'd have a
      house of my own, and the finest I could get in London. Now such a house as
      my aunt Pierrepoint's&mdash;and servants&mdash;and carriages&mdash;and I
      would make myself of some consequence."
    </p>
    <p>
      This speech was not lost upon our heroine; and the whisper in which it was
      spoken increased its effect. The next day, as Lady Bab was sitting at the
      foot of Almeria's bed, she asked for a description of "my aunt
      Pierrepoint's house." It was given to her <i>con amore</i>, and a
      character of "my aunt Pierrepoint" was added gratis. "She is the most
      charming amiable woman in the world&mdash;quite a different sort of person
      from mamma. She has lived all her life about court, and she is connected
      with all the great people, and a prodigious favourite at court&mdash;and
      she is of such consequence!&mdash;You cannot imagine of what consequence
      she is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Gabriella then continued the conversation, by telling Miss Turnbull a
      great secret, that her aunt Pierrepoint and her mother were not on the
      best terms in the world: "for mamma's so violent, you know, about
      politics, and quite on a contrary side to my aunt. Mamma never goes to
      court; and, between you and me, they say she would not be received. Now
      that is a shocking thing for us; but the most provoking part of the
      business is, that mamma won't let my aunt Pierrepoint present us. Why,
      when she cannot or will not go to the drawing-room herself, what could be
      more proper, you know, than to let us be presented by Lady Pierrepoint?&mdash;Lady
      Pierrepoint, you know, who is such a prodigious favourite, and knows every
      thing in the world that's proper at court, and every where: it really is
      monstrous of mamma! Now if you were in our places, should not you be quite
      provoked? By-the-bye, you never were presented at court yourself, were
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never," said Almeria, with a sudden feeling of mortification.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you could not&mdash;of course you could not, living with mamma as you
      do; for I am sure she would quarrel with an angel for just only talking of
      going to court. Lord! if I was as rich as you, what beautiful birthday
      dresses I would have!"
    </p>
    <p>
      These and similar conversations wrought powerfully upon the weak mind of
      our poor heroine. She rose from her bed after her illness wondering what
      had become of her passion for Frederick Elmour: certainly she was now able
      to console herself for his loss, by the hopes of being presented at court,
      and of being dressed with uncommon splendour. She was surprised at this
      change in her own mind; but she justified it to herself by the reflection,
      that it would show an unbecoming want of spirit to retain any remains of
      regard for one who had treated her with so much coldness and indifference,
      and who in all probability was attached to another woman. Pride and
      resentment succeeded to tenderness; and she resolved to show Frederick and
      Ellen that she could be happy her own way. It is remarkable that her
      friendship for the sister always increased or decreased with her love for
      her brother. Ambition, as it has often been observed, is a passion that
      frequently succeeds to love, though love seldom follows ambition. Almeria,
      who had now recovered her strength, was one morning sitting in her own
      room, meditating arrangements for the next winter's campaign, when she was
      roused by the voices of Lady Bab and Lady Kitty at her room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Turnbull! Miss Turnbull! come! come!&mdash;Here's the king and queen
      and all the royal family, and my aunt Pierrepoint&mdash;come quick to our
      dressing-room windows, or they will be out of sight."
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair hoydens seized her between them, and dragged her away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mamma says it's horribly vulgar to run to the windows, but never mind
      that. There's my aunt Pierrepoint's coach&mdash;is not it handsome?&mdash;Oh!
      everything about her is so handsome!&mdash;you know she has lived all her
      life at court."
    </p>
    <p>
      The eulogiums of these young ladies, and the sight of Lady Pierrepoint's
      entry in to Cheltenham in the wake of royalty, and the huzzas of the mob,
      and the curiosity of all ranks who crowded the public walks in the
      evening, to see the illustrious guest, contributed to raise our heroine's
      enthusiasm. She was rather surprised afterwards to observe that Lady
      Pierrepoint passed her sister and nieces, on the public walk, without
      taking the slightest notice of them; her head was turned indeed quite
      another way when she passed, and she was in smiling conversation with one
      of her own party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Gabriella whispered, "My aunt Pierrepoint cannot <i>know</i> us now,
      because we are with mamma."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Turnbull now, for the first time, saw Lady Bradstone in a situation
      in which she was neglected; this served to accelerate the decline and fall
      of her ladyship's power over her mind. She began to consider her not as a
      person by whom she had been brought into notice in the circles of fashion,
      but as one by whom she was prevented from rising to a higher orbit. Lady
      Bradstone went to see her sister the day after her arrival, but she was <i>not
      at home</i>. Some days afterwards Lady Pierrepoint returned her visit: she
      came in a sedan chair, because she did not wish that her carriage should
      be seen standing at Lady Bradstone's door. It was incumbent upon her to
      take every possible precaution to prevent the suspicion of her being
      biassed by sisterly affection; her sister and she were unfortunately of
      such different opinions in politics, and her sister's politics were so
      much disapproved of, where Lady Pierrepoint most wished for approbation,
      that she could not, consistently with her principles or interest,
      countenance them, by appearing in public with one so obnoxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Turn bull observed, with the most minute attention, every word and
      gesture of Lady Pierrepoint. At first view, her ladyship appeared all
      smiling ease and affability; but in all her motions, even in those of her
      face, there was something that resembled a puppet&mdash;her very smiles,
      and the turns of her eyes, seemed to be governed by unseen wires. Upon
      still closer observation, however, there was reason to suspect that this
      puppet might be regulated by a mind within, of some sort or other; for it
      could not only answer questions by a voice of its own, and apparently
      without being prompted, but moreover it seemed to hesitate, and to take
      time for thought, before it hazarded any reply. Lady Pierrepoint spoke
      always as if she thought her words would be repeated, and must <i>lead to
      consequences</i>; and there was an air of vast circumspection and mystery
      about her, which appeared sublime or ridiculous according to the light in
      which it was considered. To our heroine it appeared sublime. Her
      ladyship's conversation, if a set of unmeaning phrases be deserving of
      that name, at length turned upon the concern she felt that it had not been
      in her power to procure an increase of pension for a certain Mrs. Vickars.
      "Such a respectable character!&mdash;the widow of a distant relation of
      the Pierrepoints." There was no probability, after all the interest and
      influence she had used, she said, that Mrs. Vickars could ever be
      gratified in the line she had attempted; that therefore it was her
      ladyship's advice to her to look out for some situation of an eligible
      description, which might relieve her from the distressing apprehension of
      appearing burdensome or importunate.
    </p>
    <p>
      As well as her ladyship's meaning could be made out, cleared from the
      superfluity of words with which it was covered, she wished to get rid of
      this poor widow, and to fasten her as an humble companion upon any body
      who would be troubled with <i>such a respectable character!</i> Miss
      Turnbull foresaw the possibility of obliging her ladyship by means of Mrs.
      Vickars: for as she proposed to purchase a house in town, it would be
      convenient to her to have some companion; and this lady, who was of a
      certain age, and who had always lived in the best company, would be well
      suited to serve as her chaperon. To do our heroine justice, considering
      that she was unpractised in manoeuvring with court ladies, she conducted
      her scheme with a degree of address worthy of her object. Through the
      medium of Lady Bab and Lady Gabriella, she opened a correspondence with
      Lady Pierrepoint. Mrs. Vickars was introduced to Miss Turnbull&mdash;liked
      her prodigiously; and Lady Pierrepoint was most happy in the prospect of
      her relation's being so eligibly situated. In proportion as Miss Turnbull
      advanced in the good graces of Lady Pierrepoint, she receded from Lady
      Bradstone. This lady's indignation, which had been excited against Almeria
      by her not siding with her against her daughters, now rose to the highest
      pitch, when she perceived what was going on. No crime could in her eyes be
      greater than that of seceding from her party. Her violence in party
      matters was heightened by the desire to contrast herself with her sister
      Pierrepoint's courtly policy. Lady Bradstone, all the time, knew and cared
      very little about politics, except so far as they afforded her
      opportunities for the display of spirit and eloquence. She had a fine flow
      of words, and loved to engage in argument, especially as she had often
      been told by gentlemen that her enthusiasm became her extremely, and that,
      even if a man could resist the force of her arguments, he must yield to
      the fire of her eyes. It happened that Miss Turnbull was present one day
      when Lady Bradstone had been unusually warm in a political argument, and
      Lady Pierrepoint as cool and guarded as her sister was eager. Almeria was
      appealed to, and gave judgment in favour of Lady Pierrepoint, who happened
      to be in the right. Regardless of right or wrong, Lady Bradstone became
      more and more vehement, whilst Lady Pierrepoint sat in all the composed
      superiority of silence, maintaining the most edifying meekness of
      countenance imaginable, as if it were incumbent on her to be, or at least
      to seem, penitent for a sister's perversity. She sighed deeply when the <i>tirade</i>
      was finished, and fixed her eyes upon her beautiful niece Gabriella. Lady
      Gabriella immediately filled up the pause by declaring that she knew
      nothing of politics and hoped she never should, for that she did not know
      of what use they were to women, except to prevent them from going to
      court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Bradstone expressed high indignation at perceiving that her daughters
      thought more of dancing at a birthnight ball than of the good of the
      nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vickars, who was present, now interposed a word as mediatrix,
      observing, that it was natural for the young ladies at their age: and Miss
      Turnbull, catching or imitating something of the tone of Lady Pierrepoint,
      ventured to add, that "it was a pity that Lady Bradstone's daughters did
      not enjoy all the advantages of their high rank, and that she really
      wished Lady Bradstone could be prevailed upon to enter into conciliatory
      measures."
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing this speech, Lady Bradstone, no longer able to restrain her
      anger within the bounds of politeness, exclaimed, "I am not surprised at
      receiving such advice from you, Miss Turnbull; but I own I am astonished
      at hearing such sentiments from my daughters. High sentiments are to be
      expected from high birth."
    </p>
    <p>
      How Lady Bradstone contrived to make her aristocratic pride of birth agree
      with her democratic principles, it may be difficult to explain; but
      fortunately the idea of preserving consistency never disturbed her
      self-complacency. Besides, to keep her ladyship in countenance, there are
      so many examples of persons who live as royalists and talk as republicans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almeria could not brook the affront implied by Lady Bradstone's last
      speech; and matters were now brought to a crisis: she resolved not to
      remain longer in a house where she was exposed to such insults. She was of
      "age, and, thank Heaven! independent."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Bradstone made no opposition to her determination; but congratulated
      her upon the prospect of becoming independent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I agree with you, Miss Turnbull, in thanking Heaven for making me
      independent. Independence of mind, of course," added she, "I value above
      independence of purse."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever vexation our heroine might feel from this speech, and from the
      perfect indifference with which Lady Bradstone parted from her, was
      compensated by the belief that she had by her conduct this evening
      ingratiated herself with Lady Pierrepoint. She was confirmed in this
      opinion by Mrs. Vickars, who said that her ladyship afterwards spoke of
      Miss Turnbull as a very judicious and safe young person, whom she should
      not scruple to protect. She was even so condescending as to interest
      herself about the house in town, which Miss Turnbull talked of purchasing:
      she knew that a noble friend of hers, who was going on a foreign embassy,
      had thoughts of parting with his house; and it would certainly suit Miss
      Turnbull, if she could compass the purchase. Almeria felt herself highly
      honoured by her ladyship's taking a concern in any of her affairs; and she
      begged of Mrs. Vickars to say, that "expense was no object to her." She
      consequently paid a few hundred guineas more than the value of the house,
      for the honour of Lady Pierrepoint's interference. Her ladyship saw into
      the weakness of our heroine's character, and determined to make advantage
      of it. It was a maxim of hers, that there is no person so insignificant,
      but some advantage may be made of them; and she had acted upon this
      principle through life, sometimes so as to excite in the minds of the
      ignorant a high admiration of her affability. It is said, that when Lady
      Pierrepoint was asked why she married, she replied, "To increase my
      consequence, and strengthen my connexions."
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps this speech was made for her by some malicious wit; but it is
      certain that she never upon any occasion of her life neglected an
      opportunity of acting upon this principle. She was anxious with this view
      to have as many dependents as possible: and she well knew that those who
      were ambitious of a curtsy from her at the playhouse, or a whisper at the
      opera, were as effectually her dependents as the mendicants at her door,
      who are in want of a shilling. The poor may be held in the iron fetters of
      necessity, but the rich are dragged behind the car of fashion by the
      golden chains of vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer in the life of a fine lady is a season comparatively of so
      little consequence, that the judicious historian may pass over some months
      of it without their being missed in the records of time. He hastens to the
      busy and important season of winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our heroine took possession of her magnificent house in town: and Mrs.
      Vickars was established as <i>arbitratrix elegantiarum</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lady deemed herself a judge in the last appeal of every thing that
      became a person of fashion; and her claim to infallibility upon those
      points was established by her being fourth cousin to Lady Pierrepoint.
      Almeria soon discovered in her companion an inordinate love of power, and
      an irritability of temper, which misfortunes and ill health had increased
      to such a degree that it required more than the patience of a female Job
      to live with her upon good terms. Martyrs in the cause of vanity certainly
      exhibit wonderful, if not admirable, fortitude, in the midst of the absurd
      and extravagant torments which they inflict upon themselves. Our heroine
      endured for a whole season, without any outward complaint, but with many
      an inward groan, the penance which she had imposed upon herself: the
      extent of it can be comprehended only by those who have been doomed to
      live with a thoroughly ill-tempered woman. The reward was surely
      proportioned to the sufferings. Miss Turnbull received a smile, or a nod,
      or something like a curtsy from Lady Pierrepoint, whenever she met her in
      public; her ladyship's cards were occasionally left at the Yorkshire
      heiress's door; and she sometimes honoured Miss Turnbull's crowded rooms,
      by crowding them still more with her august presence. There was further
      reason to hope, that her ladyship might be induced to present Almeria at
      court before the next birthday. All these advantages were to be attributed
      to Mrs. Vickars, for she was the connecting link between two beings of
      inferior and superior order. We forbear to describe, or even to enumerate,
      the variety of balls, suppers, dinners, déjeunés, galas, and masquerades,
      which Miss Turnbull gave to the fashionable world during this winter. The
      generous public forget these things the week after they are over; and the
      consequence they bestow endures no longer than the track of a triumphal
      chariot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our heroine was never fully convinced of this truth till it was confirmed
      by her own experience. She found it necessary continually to renew her
      expensive efforts, to keep herself alive in the memory of her great
      acquaintance. Towards the time when she expected to be presented at court
      by Lady Pierrepoint, a sudden coolness was apparent in her ladyship's
      manner; and one morning Almeria was surprised by a note from her,
      regretting, in the most polite but positive terms, that it would be
      absolutely out of her power to have the honour of presenting Miss Turnbull
      at St. James's. In the utmost consternation, Almeria flew for an
      explanation to Mrs. Vickars. Mrs. Vickars was in a desperate fit of <i>the
      sullens</i>, which had lasted now upwards of eight-and-forty hours, ever
      since her advice had not been taken about the placing of certain bronze
      figures, with antique lamps in their hands, upon the great staircase. It
      was necessary to bring the lady into a good humour in the first place, by
      yielding to her uncontrolled dominion over the <i>candelabras</i>. This
      point being settled, and an unqualified submission in all matters of
      taste, past, present, or to come, declared or implied on the part of our
      heroine, Mrs. Vickars on her part promised to set out immediately on an
      embassy to Lady Pierrepoint, to discover the cause of the present
      discontent. After making sundry ineffectual attempts to see her noble
      relation, she was at last admitted; and after one hour's private audience,
      she returned to the anxious Almeria with a countenance lengthened to the
      utmost stretch of melancholy significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What <i>is</i> the matter, Mrs. Vickars?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was long before this question was answered; but after many friendly
      lamentations, Mrs. Vickars could not help observing, that Miss Turnbull
      had nobody to blame in this business but herself. This, or any thing else,
      she was willing to admit, to get at the point, "But what have I done? I
      dare say it is, as you say, all my own fault&mdash;but tell me how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How!&mdash;Can you, my dearest Miss Turnbull, forget that you did the
      most imprudent and really unaccountable thing, that ever woman did?&mdash;Lady
      Pierrepoint <i>had it</i> from Stock the banker. Now you must be certainly
      conscious to what I allude."
    </p>
    <p>
      Almeria still looked innocent till Mrs. Vickars produced the book
      dedicated to Lady Bradstone, for twelve copies of which Miss Turnbull had
      subscribed. Her name was printed among the list of subscribers, and there
      was no palliating the fact. When her companion saw that she was quite
      overwhelmed with the sense of this misfortune, she began to hint, that
      though the evil was great, it was not without remedy; that in her own
      private opinion, Lady Pierrepoint might have passed over the thing, if she
      had not heard it at a most unlucky moment. The provoking banker mentioned
      it to her ladyship just after he had disappointed her of certain moneys,
      for which she was negotiating. From her situation and means of obtaining
      secret and early intelligence, she had it frequently in her power to make
      money by selling in or out of the stocks. Such an opportunity at present
      occurred; and "it was a great pity," Mrs. Vickars observed, "that the want
      of a little ready money should preclude her from the possibility of
      profiting by her situation." Miss Turnbull, who was not deficient in
      quickness of comprehension, upon this hint immediately said, "that her
      ladyship might command some thousands which she had in Sir Thomas Stock's
      bank." Lady Pierrepoint the next day found that it would be best to hush
      up the affair of the subscription to the fatal pamphlet. She said, "that
      she had with infinite satisfaction ascertained, that the thing had not
      been noticed in the quarter where she feared it would have created an
      insuperable prejudice&mdash;that there were other Turnbulls, as she was
      happy to understand, in the world, besides Mrs. Vickars's friend; and that
      as, in the list of subscribers, she was mentioned only as <i>Miss</i>
      Turnbull, not as Almeria Turnbull, all was safe, and nobody would suspect
      that a lady presented at court by my Lady Pierrepoint could be the same
      person that subscribed to a book of such a description."
    </p>
    <p>
      This affair being adjusted, the league was tacitly formed between interest
      and vanity. Miss Turnbull was presented at court by Lady Pierrepoint, and
      her ladyship bought into the stocks with the Yorkshire heiress's money.
      The gratification of Almeria's ambition, however, did not complete her
      happiness. When she was at the summit of the Alps of fashion, she saw how
      little was to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though she liked to have it to say that she was a great deal with Lady
      Pierrepoint, yet the time always passed most heavily in her company; nor
      was the inferiority of this lady's understanding compensated by an
      affectionate heart. Her smoothly polished exterior prevented all
      possibility of obtaining any hold over her. She had the art at once to
      seem to be intimate with people, and to keep them at the greatest
      distance; as, in certain optical deceptions, an object which appears close
      to us, eludes our hand if we attempt to grasp it. Almeria felt the want of
      that species of unreserved confidence and friendship which she had
      formerly enjoyed with Ellen. In judging of what will make us happy, we are
      apt to leave time out of the account; and this leads to most important
      errors. For a short period we may be amused or gratified by what will
      fatigue and disgust us if long continued. The first winter that she spent
      in dissipation she was amused; but winter after winter passed; and the
      recurrence of the same public diversions, and the same faces, and the same
      common-place conversation, wearied instead of interesting her. But as the
      pleasure of novelty declined, the power of habit increased; and she
      continued the same course of life for six years&mdash;six long years!
      against both her judgment and her feelings, the absolute slave of an
      imaginary necessity. Thus the silly chicken remains prisoner in a circle
      of chalk: even when the hand by which it was held down is removed, it
      feels an imaginary pressure, from which it dares not even attempt to
      escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almeria, however, was now arrived at an age when she could no longer, with
      any propriety, be called a chicken: she was seven-and-twenty; and the
      effect of keeping late hours, and the continual petty irritations to which
      she had been subject, were sufficiently visible in her countenance. She
      looked in a morning so faded and haggard, that any one not used to the <i>wear
      and tear</i> of fashionable faces would have guessed Almeria's age to be
      seven-and-thirty instead of seven-and-twenty. During her six campaigns in
      London, she or her fortune had made many conquests; but none of her London
      captives had ever obtained any power over her affections, and her ambition
      could not decide upon the pretensions of her several suitors. Lady
      Pierrepoint, who was her prime adviser, had an interest in keeping her
      unmarried; because during this time her ladyship employed most
      advantageously certain moneys, which she had borrowed from our heiress.
      This female politician made some objection to every proposal; continually
      repeating, that Miss Turnbull might do better&mdash;that she might look
      higher&mdash;that with her pretensions, there could be no doubt that she
      would have a variety of advantageous offers&mdash;and that her <i>play</i>
      should be to raise her value by rejecting, without hesitation, all
      pretenders but those of the first distinction. Lady Pierrepoint, who
      usually spoke with all the ambiguity of an oracle, seemed on this subject
      more than usually mysterious. She dropped half sentences, then checked
      herself, hinted that she was not at liberty to speak out; but that she had
      her own private reasons for advising her friend Miss Turnbull not to be
      precipitate in her choice. Her ladyship's looks said more than her words,
      and Almeria interpreted them precisely as she wished. There was a certain
      marquis, whom she sometimes met at Lady Pierrepoint's, and whom she would
      have been pleased to meet more frequently. He was neither young, nor
      handsome, nor witty, nor wise. What was he then?&mdash;He was a marquis&mdash;and
      is not that enough?&mdash;Almeria saw that he was looked up to as a person
      of great influence and importance, and she now had the habit of trusting
      to the eyes and ears of others. She now considered what people were <i>thought
      of</i>, not what they really were; and according to this mode of
      estimation she could not fail to form a high opinion of this exalted
      personage. He paid her distinguished, but not decisive attention; and
      perhaps the uncertainty in which she was kept as to his views increased
      her interest upon the subject. There was always some obstacle, which
      seemed to prevent him from declaring himself:&mdash;at one time he was
      suddenly obliged to go ambassador to some foreign court; he went, and
      stayed a year; at his return he was immersed in politics, and deplored his
      hard fate in terms which Almeria thought it was impossible not to construe
      favourably to her wishes. She thought she was upon the point of becoming a
      marchioness, when his lordship was again sent into what he called
      banishment. Lady Pierrepoint had constantly letters from him, however;
      passages from which she from time to time read to Almeria, in whose weak
      mind this kept alive an indistinct hope, for which she had no rational
      foundation. She was confirmed in her belief that the marquis had serious
      thoughts of her, by the opinion of Mrs. Vickars, who she thought was in
      the secret, and who certainly would not speak decidedly without sufficient
      reason. Indeed, nothing but the pleasure she received from Mrs. Vickars's
      favourable prognostics upon this subject could have in any degree balanced
      the pain she daily endured from this lady's fretful temper. Almeria
      submitted to her domineering humour, and continued to propitiate her with
      petty sacrifices, more from fear than love&mdash;from fear that her
      adverse influence might be fatal to her present scheme of aggrandizement.
      Weak minds are subject to this apprehension of control from secret causes
      utterly inadequate to their supposed effects; and thus they put their
      destiny into the hands of persons who could not otherwise obtain influence
      over their fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time at length arrived when our heroine was to be confirmed in her
      expectations, or wakened from her state of self-delusion. The marquis
      returned from abroad, and Lady Pierrepoint wrote a note more mysteriously
      worded than usual, signifying that she "wished to have a conference with
      Miss Turnbull on a subject of some importance; and begged to know at what
      hour in the morning she might be secure of the pleasure of finding her at
      home." Almeria named her hour, and waited for its arrival with no small
      impatience. Lady Pierrepoint's thundering knock at the door was heard; her
      ladyship was shown up stairs; and she entered the room with a countenance
      that seemed to promise well. She preluded with many flattering phrases&mdash;declared
      that ever since she had been first acquainted with Miss Turnbull at
      Cheltenham, she had always considered her with sentiments of esteem, of
      which she had since given indeed the most convincing proofs, by accepting
      of obligations from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Obligations!" exclaimed Almeria, with an air of polite astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear Miss Turnbull," continued her ladyship, with still more
      polite humility, "I am under obligations to you assuredly. Things of a
      pecuniary nature ought not to be named, I confess, in the same sentence
      with friendship; yet for the sake of one's family it is, whilst we remain
      in this world, the duty of every one to pay a certain degree of attention
      to such points; and a person who has, like me, advantages of situation and
      connexions, would not be justifiable in neglecting, under due limitations,
      to make use of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Turnbull readily assented to these guarded truisms, but wondered to
      what all this was to lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The money which you have had the goodness to trust in my hands,"
      continued her ladyship, "has, without in the least impoverishing, or, I
      hope, <i>inconveniencing</i> you, been of the most material advantage to
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Almeria comprehended that her ladyship referred to her speculations in the
      stocks, and she congratulated her upon her success; and added assurances,
      that for her own part she had not been in the slightest degree <i>inconvenienced</i>.
      Whilst Miss Turnbull uttered these assurances, however, she was not sorry
      to see Lady Pierrepoint take out of her pocket-book bank notes to the
      amount of her debt; for in plain truth, the interest of this loan had
      never been punctually paid; and Almeria had often regretted that she had
      placed so much of her fortune out of her own power. "Let me now return
      these to you with a thousand thanks," said her ladyship. "Indeed, my niece
      Gabriella has more reason even than I have to thank you; for you must
      know, my dear Miss Turnbull, that all my speculations have been for her.
      From the time that she came to live with me, I was determined that she
      should be properly established; and you must be sensible that, for a young
      lady's establishment in our days, money is as essential as beauty. La
      belle Gabrielle is now provided for as she ought to be, and of course the
      consequence will be a suitable alliance." Miss Turnbull expressed her
      satisfaction at finding that her money had been instrumental in attaining
      so happy a purpose, and presumed to ask if her ladyship had any immediate
      alliance in view.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a secret as yet; but I have no secrets for you, my dear Miss
      Turnbull: indeed, I came here this morning by our dear Gabriella's
      particular desire to communicate it to you. I flatter myself you will
      approve of her choice&mdash;our favourite marquis."
    </p>
    <p>
      Almeria was so much astonished and shocked by these words, that she turned
      as pale as if she were going to faint. "Our favourite marquis!" she
      repeated in a faltering voice; "I thought&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The fear of becoming ridiculous restrained her anger, and she paused.&mdash;"You
      thought, perhaps," resumed the perfectly-composed Lady Pierrepoint, "you
      thought, perhaps, my dear, that there was too great a disparity of age
      between Gabriella and the marquis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! no."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, that is an objection, I confess; at least it would be to some young
      ladies: but as Gabriella is satisfied, we may waive that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! yes, certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One cannot help being interested for him; he is such a respectable
      character&mdash;and so much in love! It would really surprise you, my
      dear; for you know he was a man, one would have imagined, so much immersed
      in politics&mdash;I protest I never had a suspicion of his having a
      thought of Gabriella, till the proposal was absolutely made."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure <i>I</i> never suspected the marquis's attachment to Lady
      Gabriella," said Miss Turnbull: "on the contrary&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary," pursued Lady Pierrepoint, "he paid her always, as I
      remember, less attention than to twenty others, who were indifferent to
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The struggle was still violent in our heroine's mind between rage and the
      dread of exposing herself to ridicule. Lady Pierrepoint saw this, and
      coolly held her in this dilemma.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," continued her ladyship, "men are such unaccountable creatures, one
      never can understand them. Do you know, my dear Miss Turnbull, I had, till
      his lordship explained himself unequivocally to me, a notion that he was
      in love with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really!" said our heroine, forcing a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did your friend Mrs. Vickars never tell you so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, she did&mdash;frequently."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both of us mistaken, you see, my dear. Mortifying! to find one's judgment
      so fallible. I tell the marquis, he might absolutely have been privately
      married to Gabriella without my finding him out&mdash;it is so easy now,
      the easiest thing in the world, to impose upon me. Well, I must bid you
      adieu for the present, my dear Miss Turnbull&mdash;you may imagine I have
      a world of business on my hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      With the utmost appearance of cordiality Lady Pierrepoint shook our
      heroine's receding hand; and, without seeming to notice the painful
      emotions visible in Almeria's countenance, departed smiling, and perfectly
      composed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment that her ladyship had left the room, our heroine retired to her
      own apartment, and hastily bolted the door to prevent the intrusion of
      Mrs. Vickars, whose curiosity and condolence, whether real or affected,
      she was not in a humour to endure. She walked up and down the room in
      great agitation, by turns angry with Lady Pierrepoint, with the marquis,
      with Lady Gabriella, with Mrs. Vickars, and with herself. After her anger
      had spent itself, the sorrowful certainty that it was unavailing remained;
      the disappointment was irremediable, and her mortification was the more
      poignant, because she had no human being to sympathize in her feelings, no
      one to whom she could complain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So this is fashionable friendship!" said she to herself. "This is the end
      of all Lady Pierrepoint's and Lady Gabriella's professions of regard for
      me!&mdash;Fool that I have been, to become their dupe!&mdash;With my eyes
      open I saw nothing that was going forward, though now I can recollect a
      thousand and a thousand circumstances, by which I might have been
      undeceived. But I trusted implicitly&mdash;idiot that I was!&mdash;to the
      friendship of this treacherous, unfeeling courtier. Once I had a friend,
      to whom I might trust implicitly&mdash;I never, never, shall find her
      equal."
    </p>
    <p>
      A transient recollection of former times crossed her mind&mdash;but those
      times could not be recalled; and the present pressed upon her most
      forcibly. Frustrated in all her ambitious schemes, she was sensible that
      all that now remained for her was to conceal her disappointment, and to
      avoid the contempt to which she would be exposed in the world, if it were
      whispered that Miss Turnbull had fancied that the Marquis of &mdash;&mdash;
      was in love with her, whilst he was all the while paying his addresses to
      Lady Gabriella Bradstone. This powerful fear of ridicule conquered, or
      suppressed, all other feelings. With all the resolution she could assume,
      Almeria went to Mrs. Vickars, and congratulated her upon the happy event
      which was soon likely to take place in her family: she even constrained
      herself so far, as, without expressing either suspicion or resentment, to
      hear her companion disclaim all knowledge of the affair, and declare that
      she had, that morning, for the first time, heard of it from Lady
      Pierrepoint, with a degree of astonishment from which she had not yet
      recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few weeks afterwards Lady Gabriella's marriage took place. Our
      heroine's mortification was much increased by the splendour in which the
      bride appeared, and by the great share of the public attention which the
      fair marchioness seemed for some days to engross. Miss Turnbull was weary
      of hearing the praises of her equipages and dress; and the dissimulation
      she was continually obliged to practise towards Mrs. Vickars became
      intolerable. Nothing but a pretext for quarrelling with this lady was
      wanting to Almeria, and nothing but an excuse for leaving Almeria was now
      desired by Mrs. Vickars, who had received an invitation from the
      marchioness, which she was impatient to accept. The ladies one morning
      after breakfast fell into a dispute upon the comparative merits of blue
      and green. It was not to all appearance a very dangerous subject, but in
      certain situations every subject becomes dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This riband is a beautiful blue," said Miss Turnbull.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I confess I do not think so," said Mrs. Vickars; "it is a very unbecoming
      shade of blue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unbecoming!&mdash;I have been told by twenty people, that it is
      remarkably becoming to me. Mrs. Ingoldsby told me yesterday, that she
      never saw so beautiful a blue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Ingoldsby's taste is not infallible, I imagine," said Mrs. Vickars,
      with a contemptuous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may not be infallible," replied our heroine, "but it is at least as
      much to be relied upon as other people's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure I do not pretend to compare my taste to Mrs. Ingoldsby's; but I
      may be permitted to have an opinion of my own, I hope: and in my opinion
      it is a frightful blue, and shockingly unbecoming. And at all events I
      like green infinitely better than blue; and I beseech you, Miss Turnbull,
      not to wear this hideous riband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure I don't pretend to set my taste in competition with Mrs.
      Vickars's, but I must confess I cannot think this a frightful blue, or
      shockingly unbecoming; nor can I agree with any body in preferring green
      to blue; and for once I shall take the liberty of following my own fancy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For once!&mdash;I am sorry I ever presumed to offer an opinion upon this
      or any other subject to Miss Turnbull&mdash;I shall be more cautious in
      future; but I candidly own I did think I might prefer green to blue
      without giving offence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It gives me no offence, I assure you, Mrs. Vickars, that you should
      prefer green to blue; I am not so ridiculous. But people who cannot bear
      to be contradicted themselves are always apt to fancy that others have the
      same strange sort of domineering temper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "People who can bear nothing but flattery, Miss Turnbull, should have such
      a friend as Mrs. Ingoldsby, who would swear that blue is green, and black
      white, I make no doubt," said Mrs. Vickars; "for my part, I am sorry I
      cannot get rid of my troublesome sincerity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sincerity! Sincerity!&mdash;To do you justice, Mrs. Vickars, whatever I
      may have felt about trifles, in affairs of importance I have never found
      your <i>sincerity</i> troublesome."
    </p>
    <p>
      The ironical accent upon the word <i>sincerity</i> sufficiently marked
      Miss Turnbull's meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The irritable temper of Mrs. Vickars put it out of her power to act a part
      with that "exquisite dissimulation," for which some of her sex have been
      celebrated by the judicious Davila. Thrown off her guard by the last
      sarcastic insinuation, Mrs. Vickars burst into an angry defence of her own
      sincerity with respect to the affair of the marquis and Lady Gabriella.
      Almeria observed, that this "defence was quite unnecessary, as she had not
      made any accusation; and these apologies could be prompted only by Mrs.
      Vickars's own <i>tenderness</i> of conscience." Mrs. Vickars replied with
      increasing acrimony. She said, that her "conduct needed no apologies, and
      that she should not stoop to make any, to soothe the disappointed ambition
      of any person whatever." Reproach succeeded reproach&mdash;sarcasm
      produced sarcasm&mdash;till at last Mrs. Vickars declared, that after what
      had passed it was impossible she should remain another day in Miss
      Turnbull's house. This declaration was heard by Almeria with undisguised
      satisfaction. The next day Mrs. Vickars accepted of an invitation from the
      marchioness; and our heroine afterwards protested that she was as much
      rejoiced to be freed from the encumbrance of such a companion as Sinbad
      the sailor was to get rid of the old man of the sea, who fastened himself
      upon his shoulders with such remorseless tenacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She resolved to be more cautious in choice of her next companion. There
      were many candidates for the honour of supplying the place of Mrs.
      Vickars; amongst these was Mrs. Ingoldsby, a lady who was perfect mistress
      of the whole art of flattery, by means of which she had so far ingratiated
      herself with Miss Turnbull, that she felt secure of a preference over all
      competitors. Almeria had indeed almost decided in her favour, when she
      received a note from a Mrs. Wynne, an old lady with whom she had formerly
      been acquainted in Yorkshire, and who, being just come to town, was eager
      to renew her intimacy with Miss Turnbull. She was a woman of an excellent
      heart, and absolutely incapable of suspecting that others could be less
      frank or friendly than herself. She was sometimes led into mistakes by
      this undistinguishing benevolence; for she imagined that all which
      appeared wrong would prove right, if properly understood; that there must
      be some good reason for every thing that seemed to be bad; that every
      instance of unkindness or insolence was undesigned; and that every quarrel
      was only a misunderstanding. Possessed by this good-natured kind of
      wrong-headedness, she frequently did the most provoking, by way of doing
      the most obliging things imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this principle she would place contending parties by surprise in the
      very situation which of all others they most wished to avoid, and then
      give the signal for a pitched battle, by begging the enemies would shake
      hands with one another. Now she had heard it reported in Yorkshire that
      there was some coolness between the Elmours and Miss Turnbull; but she was
      morally certain there could be no truth in this report, for a variety of
      the very best reasons in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the first place," argued Mrs. Wynne, "to my certain knowledge, Miss
      Turnbull was, from her infancy, always the greatest favourite at Elmour
      Grove, the pupil of the good old gentleman, and the intimate friend of the
      daughter. During that odd Hodgkinson's lifetime, Almeria was always with
      Miss Ellen Elmour, who treated her quite like a sister. I am sure I
      remember, as if it was yesterday, her introducing Miss Turnbull to me, and
      the affectionate way in which she spoke of her&mdash;and I particularly
      recollect hearing Almeria Turnbull, amongst other grateful things, say,
      that she should wish to live and die with her friends at Elmour Grove.
      Then she had stronger reasons afterwards for being attached to them&mdash;you
      know it was Mr. Frederick Elmour who gained her large fortune for her. I
      was in the court-house in York the very day the cause was decided, and I
      never heard a man speak with more energy and eloquence than Frederick
      Elmour did in her defence. It was plain, indeed, that the eloquence came
      from his heart&mdash;as to the law part of the business, I know my nephew,
      who understands those things, said it was a very nice question, and that
      if her cause had not been managed as ably as it was, she would not have
      gained her fortune. Now of course this was a thing that never could be
      forgotten. I own, I expected that there would have been a match between
      Miss Turnbull and Mr. Elmour; but Sir Thomas Stock, her guardian, took her
      away from us, and Mr. Elmour fell in love with another lady. But all this
      time Miss Turnbull has never married, though she has been so much in the
      great world, and from her large fortune must have had so many offers. I
      heard it said yesterday, that she had refused Sir Thomas Stock's eldest
      son, and my Lord Bradstone, and some others; now it is plain she would not
      marry merely for money or title. My nephew, who is so amiable and
      sensible, is just the man for her, and he had used to admire her very much
      in former times, when he met her at Elmour Grove." Mrs. Wynne hinted her
      wishes to her nephew, but he seemed not much inclined towards Miss
      Turnbull, "because," said he, "though Frederick and his sister never
      uttered a syllable to her disadvantage, I cannot, from circumstances, help
      imagining, that she has not behaved well to them; and besides, after five
      or six years spent in the great world, and in all the dissipation in which
      she has lived, her disposition cannot probably be the same as it was when
      I knew her in the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wynne could not, with her good-natured eyes, see the force of any of
      these objections, and she was determined to convince her nephew of their
      futility. With this view she formed a scheme which was to be kept a
      profound secret from the parties concerned, till the moment when it should
      be ripe for execution. She heard that Miss Turnbull was in want of a
      companion; and she knew that Mrs. Henry Elmour, a very amiable young
      widow, distantly related to the Elmour family, and who had formerly been a
      friend of Almeria's, was at this moment in great distress. She had no
      doubt that Miss Turnbull would be delighted with an opportunity of serving
      any one connected with a family to whom she owed such obligations. Mrs.
      Wynne fancied that this would be the finest occasion imaginable to prove
      to her nephew, that, notwithstanding Almeria had lately lived so much in
      the fashionable world, she had the same grateful heart as formerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eager to come to this demonstration, Mrs. Wynne wrote immediately to the
      distressed widow, begging her to come to town with all possible
      expedition; "for I have found, or at least I am morally sure of finding,
      the most charming situation your heart can desire. I say no more, that I
      may not deprive you of the pleasure of the surprise."
    </p>
    <p>
      The same day that she sent this letter to the post, she despatched the
      following note to Almeria:
    </p>
    <p>
      'MY DEAR MISS TURNBULL,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am too well persuaded of the goodness of your heart to fear that you
      should think my present interference impertinent. We used to be very good
      friends in Yorkshire, and I am sure shall be just the same in London;
      therefore I write without ceremony, as friends should. I called upon you
      twice, but found you were, unluckily, not at home. Now I have a matter
      very near my heart to speak to you about, that perhaps will turn out as
      much to your satisfaction as to mine. I cannot express myself so well as I
      could wish in writing, but am sure you will not repent your kindness, if
      you will do us the honour of dining with us in a family way on Friday
      next; and in the mean time, let me beg you will not decide your choice of
      a companion. I cannot be more explicit, lest (as I have said once before
      to-day) I should deprive you of the pleasure of the surprise. Dear madam,
      forgive this freedom in one who most sincerely wishes you well (as Friday
      will prove). My nephew, Henry Wynne (whom you may remember a great admirer
      of yours), desires his best respects; and with every good wish I remain,
      Dear Miss Turnbull's
    </p>
    <p>
      "Affectionate humble servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. WYNNE."
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter at first surprised our heroine, and afterwards afforded
      subject for much ridicule to Mrs. Ingoldsby, to whom Almeria showed it.
      She laughed at the odd freedom of the Yorkshire dame, at the old-fashioned
      plainness of the style&mdash;parenthesis within parenthesis&mdash;at last
      concluding with respects and best wishes, and <i>remaining</i> dear Miss
      Turnbull's humble servant. She opined, however, upon the third perusal of
      the letter, that Mrs. Wynne was anxious to present her nephew to Miss
      Turnbull, and that this was the real meaning of her curious note&mdash;that
      probably she wished to surprise her with the sight of some Yorkshire
      damsel, who had formed the reasonable expectation, that because Miss
      Turnbull had done her the honour to notice her ages ago in the country,
      she was to be her companion in town. Mrs. Ingoldsby further observed, that
      Mrs. Wynne, though she had not practised at court, was no bad politician
      in thus attempting to recommend a companion to Miss Turnbull, who would,
      of course, be entirely in her nephew's interests. Almeria's vanity was
      indirectly flattered by these insinuations, which tended to prove her vast
      consequence, in being thus the object of plots and counterplots; and she
      the more readily believed this, from the experience she had had of Lady
      Pierrepoint's manoeuvres. "It is really a dreadful thing," said she, "to
      be a great heiress. One must be so circumspect&mdash;so much upon one's
      guard with all the world. But poor Mrs. Wynne shows her cards so plainly,
      one must be an idiot not to guess her whole play."
    </p>
    <p>
      To "mistake reverse of wrong for right" is one of the most common errors
      in the conduct of life. Our heroine being sensible that she had been
      ridiculously credulous in her dealings with Lady Pierrepoint, was now
      inclined to be preposterously suspicious. She determined with her next
      admirer to pursue a system diametrically opposite to that which she had
      followed with the marquis; she had shown him attractive complaisance; she
      was now prepared to display the repulsive haughtiness becoming the
      representative of two hundred thousand pounds: she had completely adopted
      Lady Pierrepoint's maxim. <i>That a lady should marry to increase her
      consequence and strengthen her connexions</i>. Her former ideas, that love
      and esteem were necessary to happiness in a union for life, seemed
      obsolete and romantic; and the good qualities of her admirers, though they
      were always to be mentioned as the ostensible reasons for her choice, were
      never in reality to influence her decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      To stoop at once from a marquis to a private gentleman would be terrible;
      yet that private gentleman was worthy of some little consideration, not
      because he was, as Almeria remembered, a man of excellent sense, temper,
      and character, but because he had a clear estate of eight thousand pounds
      a-year, and was next heir to an earldom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Turnbull cannot properly be called a female fortune-hunter; but, to
      coin a new name for our heroine, which may be useful to designate a
      numerous class of her contemporaries, she was decidedly a female <i>title-hunter</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      She accepted of the invitation to dinner, and, accompanied by a proper
      supporter in Mrs. Ingoldsby, went to Mrs. Wynne's, dressed in the utmost
      extravagance of the mode, blazing in all the glory of diamonds, in hopes
      of striking admiration even unto awe upon the hearts of all beholders.
      Though she had been expressly invited to a <i>family party</i>, she
      considered that only as an humble country phrase to excuse, beforehand,
      any deficiency of magnificence. She had no doubt that the finest
      entertainment, and the finest company, Mrs. Wynne could procure or
      collect, would be prepared for her reception. She was somewhat surprised,
      especially as she came fashionably late, to find in the drawing-room only
      old Mrs. Wynne, her nephew, and a lady, who, from her dress and modest
      appearance, was evidently <i>nobody</i>. Miss Turnbull swept by her,
      though she had a disagreeable recollection of having somewhere seen this
      figure in a former state of existence. Mrs. Wynne, good soul! did not
      believe in wilful blindness, and she therefore said, with provoking
      simplicity, "Miss Turnbull, this is your good friend, Mrs. Henry Elmour&mdash;poor
      thing! she is sadly altered in her looks since you saw her, a gay rosy
      lass at Elmour Grove! But though her looks are changed, her heart, I can
      answer for it, is just the same as ever; and she remembers you with all
      the affection you could desire. She would not be like any other of her
      name, indeed, if she did otherwise. The Elmours were all so fond of you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of Elmour, instead of having that irresistible charm, which Mrs.
      Wynne expected, over Almeria's heart, produced a directly contrary effect.
      It recalled many associations that were painful to her pride; she was
      vexed to perceive that obligations and intimacies which she had forgotten,
      or which she wished to forget, were remembered so obstinately by others.
      All this passed in her mind whilst Mrs. Wynne was speaking. With a look of
      ill-humoured surprise, Almeria half rose from her seat, and, as Mrs. Henry
      Elmour was presented to her, uttered some phrases in an unintelligible
      voice, and then sunk back again on the sofa. Mrs. Wynne made room for the
      widow between her and Miss Turnbull&mdash;Mr. Wynne kept aloof&mdash;a
      dead silence ensued&mdash;and Miss Turnbull, seeing that in her present
      position there was nothing else to be done, condescended to hope that all
      Mrs. Henry Elmour's friends in Yorkshire were well when she left them.
      Mrs. Wynne's countenance brightened up, and she now addressed her
      conversation to Mrs. Ingoldsby, in order to leave the pair, whom she had
      destined to be friends, at perfect liberty to talk over "old times."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Henry Elmour naturally spoke of the happy days which they had spent
      together at Elmour Grove; but Miss Turnbull was so much occupied in
      clasping one of her diamond bracelets, that half of what was said to her
      seemed not to be heard, and the other half to create no interest. She
      looked up, when she had at length adjusted her bracelet, and with an
      insipid smile (learnt from Lady Pierrepoint) seemed to beg pardon for her
      fit of absence. The unfortunate Mrs. Elmour recommenced all she had said;
      but though Miss Turnbull's eyes were at this time directed towards the
      widow's face, they wandered over her features with such insolent
      examination, that she was totally abashed. Having gained her point, our
      heroine now looked round as the door opened, in expectation of the
      entrance of some persons who might be worthy of her attention; but, lo! it
      was only a servant, who announced that dinner was served. Miss Turnbull's
      surprise could be equalled only by her indignation, when she found that it
      was literally to a <i>family party</i> she was invited. "Miss Turnbull,"
      said Mrs. Wynne, as they were sitting down to dinner, "I have been much
      disappointed in not having the company of some friends of yours, who I
      expected would dine with us to-day; but they will be with us, I hope,
      to-night&mdash;they were unluckily engaged to dine with the Duchess of A&mdash;&mdash;."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Turnbull vouchsafed to appear interested, when the name of a duchess
      was mentioned; but her countenance again changed to an expression of
      almost angry vexation, when Mrs. Wynne explained, that these friends were
      Mr. and Mrs. Elmour, and Mr. Charles Wynne and his lady. "Miss Ellen
      Elmour, you know: she was&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"Very true, I saw her
      marriage in the papers, I remember, some time ago," replied Miss Turnbull;
      "a year, if I'm not mistaken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two years ago, madam," said Mrs. Wynne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it two?&mdash;I dare say it might&mdash;you know it is so impossible
      to keep a register of deaths and marriages in one's head. Pray, are you at
      all acquainted, Mrs. Wynne, with the Duchess of A&mdash;&mdash;? She was
      always a prodigious friend of the Elmours, as I remember. How is that?&mdash;Are
      they any way related, I wonder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; they are now related by marriage," said Mr. Wynne; "Mrs. Elmour is a
      niece of the duchess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is a charming woman," said Mr. Wynne; "so beautiful and yet so
      unaffected&mdash;so sensible, yet so unassuming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray," interrupted Mrs. Ingoldsby, "has not her grace conversaziones, or
      reading parties, or something in that style every week?&mdash;She is quite
      a learned lady, I understand. There was always something odd about her,
      and I cannot help being afraid of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I assure you," said Mrs. Wynne, "that there is nothing odd or strange
      about the Duchess of A&mdash;&mdash;. She has always the most agreeable
      society that London can afford."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Turnbull and Mrs. Ingoldsby interchanged looks of affected contempt:
      but Mr. Wynne added, "Her grace has, you know, a taste for literature and
      for the arts; and the most celebrated literary characters, as well as
      those who have distinguished themselves in active life, assemble at her
      house, where they can enjoy the most agreeable conversation&mdash;that in
      which a knowledge of books and of the world is happily blended."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And as to being afraid of her grace," resumed Mrs. Wynne, "that is quite
      impossible; she has such affable, engaging manners. I am sure, even I am
      not in the least afraid of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you know," said Miss Turnbull, with a malicious look of mock
      humility, "there is a difference between you and me.&mdash;I would not
      meet her grace for the world, for I am persuaded I should not be able to
      articulate a syllable in her classical presence&mdash;I have not been used
      to that style of company, by any means. I assure you I should be, as Mrs.
      Ingoldsby says, horribly afraid of your witty duchess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has none of the airs of a wit, believe me," said Mrs. Wynne, growing
      more and more earnest; "and if you will not believe me, ask your friend
      Ellen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, excuse me, I beseech; I shall ask no questions&mdash;I only beg leave
      to keep myself well when I am well. The Elmours who are so clever, and
      have such merit and so on, are all vastly better suited to her grace than
      I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      No contradiction ensued&mdash;our heroine was mortified beyond the power
      of concealment.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, when the ladies retired, Mrs. Wynne, though somewhat alarmed
      and puzzled by Miss Turnbull's behaviour, summoned all the resolution
      which benevolence could inspire, and resolved at once to come to the point
      with our heroine. She flattered herself that all in Miss Turnbull that
      appeared inauspicious to her hopes was only <i>her manner,</i> that sort
      of manner which people, who live much in high life, catch and practise,
      without meaning to give themselves airs, or to humble their neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many persons will perhaps think good Mrs. Wynne almost an idiot: but she
      was a woman of abilities; and if she did not exert them in discovering
      with promptitude the follies of others, she enjoyed much happiness in her
      benevolent scepticism. This evening, however, she was doomed to be
      absolutely convinced, against her will, that she had formed too favourable
      an opinion of one of her fellow-creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was eager to explain herself to Almeria before Ellen and Mr. Frederick
      Elmour should arrive; she therefore took her aside, and began without any
      preface:&mdash;"My dear Miss Turnbull, here is a charming opportunity for
      you to do a kind, and generous, and grateful action. This poor Mrs. Henry
      Elmour!&mdash;She has told you how she has been reduced to distress
      without any imprudence of hers. Now you could not, I am sure, prove the
      goodness of your own heart better to your friends (who will be here in
      half an hour) than by showing kindness to this unfortunate widow. I cannot
      presume to say more than that I think she would make a most agreeable
      companion to an amiable, sensible young lady&mdash;and you have not
      decided your choice, have you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, I have decided, beyond a possibility of retracting," replied
      Miss Turnbull, haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very sorry," said Mrs. Wynne, with an expression of real concern in
      her countenance. "I have been very imprudent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really I am infinitely distressed that it is out of my power to oblige
      her; but the lady who is with me now, Mrs. Ingoldsby, has a prior claim."
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior claim!&mdash;prior to that of the Elmour family! thought Mrs. Wynne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The decisive manner in which Miss Turnbull spoke precluded all further
      hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I did think it would have been such a pleasure to Miss Turnbull to
      meet Mrs. Henry Elmour, and all her old friends the Elmours here to-day;
      and I fancied, that if there had been any little coolness or
      misunderstanding, it would quite have passed off, and that I should have
      had the joy of seeing you all shake hands&mdash;I thought it would have
      been such an agreeable surprise to you to see all the Elmour family, and
      Ellen's charming little girl, and Mr. Frederick Elmour's boy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A more disagreeable surprise could scarcely have been imagined for our
      heroine. She informed Mrs. Wynne, coldly, that there was not the slightest
      quarrel between her and any of the Elmours; and that therefore there was
      no necessity, or possible occasion, for any shaking of hands or
      reconciliation scenes: that undoubtedly the style of life she had been
      thrown into had entirely separated her from her Yorkshire acquaintance;
      and time had dissolved the sort of intimacy that neighbourhood had
      created: that she should always, notwithstanding, be most particularly
      happy to meet any of the Elmour family; though, from her situation, it was
      a good fortune she had not often enjoyed, nor indeed could in future
      expect: but that she wished it to be understood, and repeated, that she
      always in all companies properly acknowledged the obligations she had to
      Mr. Frederick Elmour as a lawyer. Her cause, she believed, was the first
      in which he had distinguished himself; and she was rejoiced to find that
      he had since risen so rapidly in his profession.&mdash;As to Miss Ellen
      Elmour, she was a very charming, sensible young woman, no doubt; and Miss
      Turnbull assured Mrs. Wynne she was delighted to hear she was so suitably
      married in point of understanding and temper, and all that sort of thing&mdash;and
      besides, to a gentleman of a reasonable fortune, which she was happy to
      hear Mr. Charles Wynne possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she was interrupted in her speech&mdash;the door opened, and the
      Duchess of A&mdash;&mdash;, Mr. and Mrs. Elmour, and Mr. and Mrs. Charles
      Wynne, were announced. Our heroine was not prepared for the sight of the
      duchess; and her grace's appearance made her receive her old friends in a
      manner very different from that in which she had determined to meet them.
      Practised as she was, she stood irresolute and awkward, whilst Ellen, with
      easy, graceful kindness, accosted her, and immediately introduced her to
      the Duchess of A&mdash;&mdash;. As Mr. Frederick Elmour approached, and as
      his beautiful wife was presented to Miss Turnbull, not all her efforts
      could conceal the mortification she endured, whilst she pronounced that
      she was vastly happy&mdash;quite delighted&mdash;that all this was really
      such an agreeable and <i>unexpected surprise</i> to her&mdash;for she did
      not even know any of her Yorkshire friends were in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ingoldsby came up to her assistance. Miss Turnbull rallied her
      spirits, and determined to make her stand upon the exclusive ground of
      fashion. Those who comprehend the rights of the privileged orders of
      fashion are aware that even a commoner, who is in a certain <i>set</i>, is
      far superior to a duchess who is not supposed to move in that magic
      circle, Almeria, upon this principle, began to talk to the duchess of some
      of her acquaintance, who were of the highest <i>ton</i>; and then
      affectedly checked herself, and begged pardon, and looked surprised at
      Mrs. Ingoldsby, when she found that her grace was not acquainted with
      them. Much as Miss Turnbull had reason to complain of Lady Pierrepoint and
      the young bride the marchioness, she now thought that their names would do
      her honour; and she scrupled not to speak of them as her best friends, and
      as the most amiable creatures existing.&mdash;Such is the meanness and
      insufficiency of vanity!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Lady Pierrepoint," said the Duchess of A&mdash;&mdash;: "with her
      independent fortune, what could tempt her to enslave herself, as she has
      done, to a court life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her ladyship finds herself suited to her situation, I believe," said Miss
      Turnbull. "Lady Pierrepoint is certainly formed, more than most people I
      know, to succeed and shine in a court; and she is in favour, and in power,
      and in fashion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does it follow of course that she is happy?" said Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! happy&mdash;of course; I suppose so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt," said Mrs. Ingoldsby; "she has every reason to be happy: has
      not she just made her niece marchioness?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Turnbull repeated "<i>Happy!</i> to be sure Lady Pierrepoint is
      happy, if any body in the world is happy."&mdash;A short sigh escaped from
      our heroine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen heard the sigh, and attended to it more than to her words; she
      looked upon her with compassion, and endeavoured to change the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We spend this winter in town; and as I think I know your <i>real</i>
      tastes, Almeria," said she, taking Almeria's hand, "we must have the
      pleasure of introducing you to some of her grace's literary friends, who
      will, I am sure, please and suit you particularly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Frederick Elmour, who now really pitied Almeria, though in his pity
      there was a strong mixture of contempt, joined his sister in her kindness,
      and named and described some of the people whom he thought she would be
      most desirous of knowing. The names struck Miss Turnbull's ears, for they
      were the names of persons distinguished in the fashionable as well as in
      the literary world; and she was dismayed and mortified by the discovery
      that her <i>country friends</i> had by some means, incomprehensible to
      her, gained distinction and intimacy in society where she had merely
      admission; she was vexed beyond expression when she found that <i>the
      Elmours</i> were superior to her even on her own ground. At this instant
      Mrs. Wynne, with her usual simplicity, asked Mrs. Elmour and Ellen why
      they had not brought their charming children with them; adding, "You are,
      my dears, without exception, the two happiest mothers and wives I am
      acquainted with. And after all, what happiness is there equal to domestic
      happiness?&mdash;Oh! my dear Miss Turnbull, trust me, though I am a silly
      old woman, there's nothing like it&mdash;and friends at court are not like
      friends at home&mdash;and all the Lady Pierrepoints that ever were or ever
      will be born, are not, as you'll find when you come to try them, like one
      of these plain good Ellens and Elmours."
    </p>
    <p>
      The address, simple as it was, came so home to Almeria's experience, and
      so many recollections rushed at once upon her memory, that all her
      factitious character of a fine lady gave way to natural feeling, and
      suddenly she burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens! my dear Miss Turnbull," cried Mrs. Ingoldsby, "what is the
      matter?&mdash;Are not you well?&mdash;Salts! salts!&mdash;the heat of the
      room!&mdash;Poor thing!&mdash;she has such weak nerves.&mdash;Mr. Elmour,
      may I trouble you to ring the bell for our carriage? Miss Turnbull has
      such sensibility! This meeting, so unexpected, with so many old friends,
      has quite overcome her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Turnbull, recalled to herself by Mrs. Ingoldsby's voice, repeated the
      request to have her carriage immediately, and departed with Mrs. Ingoldsby
      as soon as she possibly could, utterly abashed and mortified; mortified
      most at not having been able to conceal her mortification. Incapable
      absolutely of articulating, she left Mrs. Ingoldsby to cover her retreat,
      as well as she could, with weak nerves and sensibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the charitable Mrs. Wynne was now heard to acknowledge that she could
      neither approve of Miss Turnbull's conduct, nor frame any apology for it.
      She confessed that it looked very like what she of all things detested
      most&mdash;<i>ingratitude</i>. Her nephew, who had been a cool observant
      spectator of this evening's performance, was glad that his aunt's mind was
      now decided by Almeria's conduct. He exclaimed that he would not marry
      such a woman, if her portion were to be the mines of Peru.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Miss Turnbull lost all chance of the esteem and affection of another
      man of sense and temper, who might even at this late period of her life
      have recalled her from the follies of dissipation, and rendered her
      permanently happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now that our heroine must have lost all power of interesting the
      reader, now that the pity even of the most indulgent must be utterly sunk
      in contempt, we shall take our leave of her, resigning her to that misery
      which she had been long preparing for herself. It is sufficient to say,
      that after this period she had some offers from men of fashion of ruined
      fortunes; but these she rejected, still fancying that with her wealth she
      could not fail to make a splendid match. So she went on coquetting; and
      coquetting, rejecting and rejecting, till at length she arrived at an age
      when she could reject no longer. She ceased to be an object to matrimonial
      adventurers, but to these succeeded a swarm of female legacy-hunters.
      Among the most distinguished was her companion, Mrs. Ingoldsby, whose
      character she soon discovered to be artful and selfish in the extreme.
      This lady's flattery, therefore, lost all its power to charm, but yet it
      became necessary to Almeria; and even when she knew that she was duped,
      she could not part with Mrs. Ingoldsby, because it was not in her power to
      supply the place of a flatterer with a <i>friend</i>.&mdash;A friend! that
      first blessing of life, cannot be bought&mdash;it must be deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss, or as she must now be called, <i>Mrs</i>. Almeria Turnbull, is still
      alive&mdash;probably at this moment haunting some place of public
      amusement, or stationary at the card-table. Wherever she may be, she is
      despised and discontented; one example more amongst thousands, that wealth
      cannot purchase, or fashion bestow, real happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See how the world its veterans rewards&mdash;youth of folly, an old age
      of cards!"

      PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miss Edgeworth's general views, in these stories, are explained in the
      preface to the first volume. I cannot, however, omit repeating, that
      public favour has not yet rendered her so presumptuous as to offer hasty
      effusions to her readers, but that she takes a longer time to revise what
      she writes than the severe ancients required for the highest species of
      moral fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian exposes one of the most common defects of mankind. To be "infirm of
      purpose" is to be at the mercy of the artful or at the disposal of
      accident. Look round, and count the numbers who have, within your own
      knowledge, failed from want of firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      An excellent and wise mother gave the following advice with her dying
      breath: "My son, learn early how to say, No!"&mdash;This precept gave the
      first idea of the story of Vivian.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ABSENTEE is not intended as a censure upon those whose duties, and
      employments, and superior talents, lead them to the capital; but to warn
      the thoughtless and the unoccupied from seeking distinction by frivolous
      imitation of fashion and ruinous waste of fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      A country gentleman, or even a nobleman, who does not sit in parliament,
      may be as usefully and as honourably employed in Yorkshire, Mid Lothian,
      or Ireland, as at a club-house or an assembly in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irish agents are here described as of two different species. That there
      have been bad and oppressive Irish agents, many great landed English
      proprietors have felt; that there are well-informed, just, and honourable
      Irish agents, every-day experience can testify.

    <p>
      MADAME DE FLEURY points out some of the means which may be employed by the
      rich for the real advantage of the poor. This story shows that sowing gold
      does not always produce a golden harvest; but that knowledge and virtue,
      when early implanted in the human breast, seldom fail to make ample
      returns of prudence and felicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      EMILIE DE COULANGES exposes a fault into which the good and generous are
      liable to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great sacrifices and great benefits cannot frequently be made or conferred
      by private individuals; but, every day, kindness and attention to the
      common feelings of others is within the power, and may be the practice, of
      every age, and sex, and station. Common faults are reproved by all writers
      on morality; but there are errors and defects that require to be treated
      in a lighter manner, and that come, with propriety, within the province of
      essayists and of writers for the stage.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "To see the best, and yet the worse pursue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible," exclaimed Vivian, "that you, Russell, my friend, my best
      friend, can tell me that this line is the motto of my character!&mdash;'
      To see the best, and yet the worse pursue.&mdash;Then you must think me
      either a villain or a madman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Russell, calmly; "I think you only weak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Weak&mdash;but you must think me an absolute fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not a fool; the weakness of which I accuse you is not a weakness of
      the understanding. I find no fault either with the logical or the
      mathematical part of your understanding. It is not erroneous in either of
      the two great points in which Bacon says that most men's minds be
      deficient in&mdash;the power of judging of consequences, or in the power
      of estimating the comparative value of objects."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," cried Vivian, impatiently, "but I don't want to hear just now what
      Bacon says&mdash;but what <i>you</i> think. Tell me all the faults of my
      character."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All!&mdash;unconscionable!&mdash;after the fatigue of this long day's
      journey," said Russell, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two friends were, at this time, travelling from Oxford to Vivian
      Hall (in &mdash;&mdash;shire), the superb seat of the Vivian family, to
      which Vivian was heir. Mr. Russell, though he was but a few years older
      than Vivian, had been his tutor at college; and by an uncommon transition,
      had, from his tutor, become his intimate friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause, Vivian resumed, "Now I think of it, Russell, you are to
      blame, if I have any faults. Don't you say, that every thing is to be done
      by education? And are not you&mdash;though by much too young, and
      infinitely too handsome, for a philosopher&mdash;are not you my guide,
      philosopher, and friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I have had the honour to be your guide, philosopher, and friend, only
      for these three years," said Russell. "I believe in the rational, but not
      in the magical, power of education. How could I do, or undo, in three
      years, the work of the preceding seventeen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, if you won't let me blame you, I must blame my mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your mother!&mdash;I had always understood that she had paid particular
      attention to your early education, and all the world says that Lady Mary
      Vivian, though a woman of fashion, is remarkably well-informed and
      domestic; and, judging from those of her letters which you have shown me,
      I should think that, for once, what all the world says is right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What all the world says is right, and yet I am not wrong:&mdash;my mother
      is a very clever woman, and most affectionate, and she certainly paid
      particular attention to my early education; but her attention was too
      particular, her care was too great. You know I was an only son&mdash;then
      I lost my father when I was an infant; and a woman, let her be ever so
      sensible, cannot well educate an <i>only</i> son, without some manly
      assistance; the fonder she is of the son the worse, even if her fondness
      is not foolish fondness&mdash;it makes her over-anxious&mdash;it makes her
      do too much. My mother took too much, a great deal too much, care of me;
      she over-educated, over-instructed, over-dosed me with premature lessons
      of prudence: she was so afraid that I should ever do a foolish thing, or
      not say a wise one, that she prompted my every word, and guided my every
      action. So I grew up, seeing with her eyes, hearing with her ears, and
      judging with her understanding, till, at length, it was found out that I
      had not eyes, ears, or understanding of my own. When I was between twelve
      and thirteen, my mother began to think that I was not sufficiently manly
      for my age, and that there was something too yielding and undecided in my
      character. Seized with a panic, my mother, to make a man of me at once,
      sent me to &mdash;&mdash; school. There I was, with all convenient
      expedition, made ashamed of every thing good I had learned at home; and
      there I learned every thing bad, and nothing good, that could be learned
      at school. I was inferior in Latin and Greek; and this was a deficiency I
      could not make up without more labour than I had courage to undertake. I
      was superior in general literature, but this was of little value amongst
      my competitors, and therefore I despised it; and, overpowered by numbers
      and by ridicule, I was, of course, led into all sorts of folly, by mere <i>mauvaise
      honte</i>. Had I been in the habit of exercising my own judgment, or had
      my resolution been strengthened by degrees; had I, in short, been prepared
      for a school, I might, perhaps, have acquired, by a public education, a
      manly, independent spirit. If I had even been wholly bred up in a public
      school, I might have been forced, as others were, by early and fair
      competition, to exercise my own powers, and by my own experience in that
      microcosm, as it has been called, I might have formed some rules of
      conduct, some manliness of character, and might have made, at least, a
      good schoolboy. Half home-bred, and half school-bred, from want of proper
      preparation, one half of my education totally destroyed the other. From
      school, of course, I went to college, and at college, of course, I should
      have become one of the worst species of college lads, and should have had
      no chance, in my whole future life, of being any thing but a dissipated
      fool of fashion, one of the <i>Four-in-Hand Club</i>, or the <i>Barouche
      Club</i>, or the <i>Tandem Club</i>, or the <i>Defiance Club</i>, had not
      I, by the greatest good fortune, met with such a friend as you, and, by
      still greater good fortune, found you out for myself; for if my mother had
      recommended you to me, I should have considered you only as a college
      tutor; I should never have discovered half your real merit; I doubt
      whether I should have even seen that you are young and handsome: so
      prejudiced should I have been with the preconceived notion of a college
      tutor, that I am not certain whether I should have found out that you are
      a gentleman as well born and well bred as myself; but, be that as it may,
      I am positive that I never should have made you my companion and friend; I
      should never have thrown open my whole soul to you, as I have done; nor
      could you ever have obtained such wondrous power as you possess over my
      mind, if you had been recommended to me by my mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry," said Russell, smiling, "that, after so many wise
      reflections, and so many fine compliments, you end by proving to me that
      my wondrous power is founded on your wondrous weakness. I am mortified to
      find that your esteem and friendship for me depended so much upon my not
      having had the honour of your mother's recommendation; and have not I
      reason to fear, that now, when I have a chance of becoming acquainted with
      Lady Mary Vivian, and, perhaps, a chance of her thinking me a fit
      companion and friend for her son, I must lose his regard and confidence,
      because I shall labour under the insuperable objection of an affectionate
      mother's approbation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," said Vivian; "my wilful folly does not go quite so far as that.
      So that I maintain the privilege of choosing my friends for myself, I
      shall always be pleased and proud to find my mother approve my choice."
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few moments' pause, Vivian added, "You misunderstand, quite
      misunderstand me, if you think that I am not fond of my mother. I respect
      and love her with all my soul:&mdash;I should be a most ungrateful wretch
      if I did not. I did very wrong to speak as I did just now, of any little
      errors she may have made in my education; but, believe me, I would not
      have said so much to any one living but yourself, nor to you, but in
      strict confidence; and, after all, I don't know whether I ought not to lay
      the blame of my faults on my masters more than on my poor mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lay the blame where we will," said Russell, "remember, that the
      punishment will rest on ourselves. We may, with as much philosophic
      justice as possible, throw the blame of our faults on our parents and
      preceptors, and on the early mismanagement of our minds; yet, after we
      have made out our case in the abstract, to the perfect satisfaction of a
      jury of metaphysicians, when we come to <i>overt</i> actions, all our
      judges, learned and unlearned, are so awed, by the ancient precedents and
      practice of society, and by the obsolete law of common sense, that they
      finish by pronouncing against us the barbarous sentence, that every man
      must suffer for his own faults."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I hope I shall be able to bear it, my lord,' as the English sailor said
      when the judge&mdash;&mdash;But look out there! Let down that glass on
      your side of the carriage!" cried Vivian, starting forward. "There's
      Vivian Hall!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That fine old castle?" said Russell, looking out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but farther off to the left, don't you see amongst the trees that
      house with wings?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! quite a new, modern house: I had always fancied that Vivian Hall was
      an old pile of building."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it was, till my father threw down the old hall, and built this new
      house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a very handsome one it is.&mdash;Is it as good within as without?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite, I think; but I'll leave you to judge for yourself.&mdash;Are not
      those fine old trees in the park?"
    </p>
    <p>
      From this time till the travellers arrived at Vivian Hall, their
      conversation turned upon trees, and avenues, and serpentine <i>approaches</i>,
      and alterations that Vivian intended to make, when he should be of age,
      and master of this fine place; and he now wanted but a twelvemonth of
      being at legal years of discretion. When they arrived at the hall, Lady
      Mary Vivian showed much affectionate joy at the sight of her son, and
      received Mr. Russell with such easy politeness that he was prepossessed at
      first in her favour. To this charm of well-bred manners was united the
      appearance of sincerity and warmth of feeling. In her conversation there
      was a mixture of excellent sense and general literature with the
      frivolities of the fashionable world, and the anecdotes of the day in
      certain high circles, of which she seemed to talk more from habit than
      taste, and to annex importance more from the compulsion of external
      circumstances than from choice. But her son,&mdash;her son was the great
      object of all her thoughts, serious or frivolous. She was delighted by the
      improvements she saw in his understanding and character; by the taste and
      talents he displayed, both for fine literature and for solid information:
      this flattered her hope that he would both shine as a polished gentleman
      and make a figure in public life. To his friend Russell she attributed
      these happy improvements; and, though he was not a tutor of her own
      original selection, yet her pride, on this occasion, yielded to gratitude,
      and she graciously declared, that she could not feel jealous of the
      pre-eminent power he had obtained over her son, when she saw the admirable
      use he made of this influence. Vivian, like all candid and generous
      persons, being peculiarly touched by candour and generosity in others,
      felt his affection for his mother rapidly increased by this conduct; nor
      did his enthusiasm for his friend in the least abate, in consequence of
      the high approbation with which she honoured him, nor even in consequence
      of her ladyship's frequent and rather injudicious expressions of her
      hopes, that her son would always preserve and show himself worthy of such
      a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      He joined in his mother's entreaties to Russell to prolong his visit; and
      as her ladyship declared she thought it of essential consequence to her
      son's interest and future happiness, that he should, at this <i>turn of
      his life</i>, have such a companion, Russell consented to remain with him
      some time longer. All parties were thus pleased with each other, and
      remained united by one common interest about the same objects, during
      several weeks of a delightful summer. But, alas! this family harmony, and
      this accord of reason and <i>will</i>, between the mother and son, were
      not of longer duration. As usual, there were faults on both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary Vivian, whose hopes of her son's distinguishing himself by his
      abilities had been much exalted since his last return from Oxford, had
      indulged herself in pleasing anticipations of the time when he should make
      his appearance in the fashionable and in the political world. She foresaw
      the respect that would be paid to her, on his account, both by senators
      and by matrons; by ministers, who might want to gain a rising orator's
      vote, and by mothers, who might wish to make an excellent match for their
      daughters: not only by all mothers who had daughters to marry, but by all
      daughters who had hearts or hands to dispose of, Lady Mary felt secure of
      having her society courted. Now, she had rather extravagant expectations
      for her son: she expected him to marry, so as to secure domestic
      happiness, and, at the same time, to have fashion, and beauty, and rank,
      and high connexions, and every amiable quality in a wife. This vision of a
      future daughter-in-law continually occupied her ladyship's imagination.
      Already, with maternal <i>Alnascharism</i>, she had, in her reveries,
      thrown back her head with disdain, as she repulsed the family advances of
      some wealthy but low-born heiress, or as she rejected the alliance of some
      of the new nobility. Already she had arranged the very words of her
      answers to these, and determined the degrees and shades of her intimacies
      with those; already had she settled
    </p>
    <p>
      "To whom to nod, whom take into her coach, Whom honour with her hand;"
    </p>
    <p>
      when one morning, as she sat at work, absorbed in one of these reveries,
      she was so far "rapt into future times," that, without perceiving that any
      body was present, she began to speak her thoughts, and said aloud to
      herself, "As if my son could possibly think of her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her son, who was opposite to her, lying on a sofa, reading, or seeming to
      read, started up, and putting down his book, exclaimed, in a voice which
      showed at once that he was conscious of thinking of some particular
      person, and determined to persist in the thought, "As if your son could
      possibly think of her!&mdash;&mdash;Of whom, ma'am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter, child? Are you mad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in the least, ma'am; but you said&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" cried Lady Mary, looking round; "What did I say, that has
      occasioned so much disturbance?&mdash;I was not conscious of saying any
      thing. My dear Selina," continued her ladyship, appealing to a young lady,
      who sat very intent upon some drawing beside her, "my dear Selina, you
      must have heard; what did I say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady looked embarrassed; and the colour which spread over her
      face, brought a sudden suspicion into Lady Mary's mind: her eye darted
      back upon her son&mdash;the suspicion, the fear was confirmed; and she
      grew instantly pale, silent, and breathless, in the attitude in which she
      was struck with this panic. The young lady's blush and embarrassment had a
      very different effect on Vivian; joy suddenly sparkled in his eyes, and
      illumined his whole countenance, for this was the first instant he had
      ever felt any hope of having obtained an interest in her heart. He was too
      much transported at this moment to think either of prudence or of his
      mother; and, when he recollected himself, he was too little practised in
      dissimulation to repair his indiscretion. Something he did attempt to say,
      and blundered, and laughed at his blunder; and when his mother looked up
      at him, in serious silence, he only begged pardon for his folly, confessed
      he believed he was mad, and, turning away abruptly, left the room,
      exclaiming that he wondered where Russell had been all the morning, and
      that he must go and look for him. A long silence ensued between Vivian's
      mother and the young lady, who were left alone together. Lady Mary first
      broke the silence, and, in a constrained tone, asked, as she took up the
      newspaper, "Whether Miss Sidney had found any news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, ma'am," answered Miss Sidney, in a voice scarcely
      articulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should have imagined there must be some news from the continent: but
      you did not find any, I think you say, Miss Sidney;" continued Lady Mary,
      with haughty, averted eyes. After turning over the pages of the paper,
      without knowing one word it contained, she laid it down, and rose to leave
      the room. Miss Sidney rose at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady Mary, one instant; my dear Lady Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary turned, and saw Selina's supplicating eyes full of tears; but
      her ladyship, still retaining her severity of manner, coldly said, "Does
      Miss Sidney desire that I should stay?&mdash;Does Miss Sidney wish to
      speak to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do&mdash;as soon as I can," said Selina in a faltering voice; but,
      raising her eyes, and perceiving the contemptuous expression of Lady
      Mary's countenance, her own instantly changed. With the firm tone of
      conscious innocence, she repeated, "I do wish to speak to your ladyship,
      if you will hear me with your usual candour; I do not expect or solicit
      your usual indulgence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Sidney," replied Lady Mary, "before you say more, it becomes me to
      point out to you, that the moment is past for confidence between us two;
      and that in no moment could I wish to hear from any person, much less from
      one whom I had considered as my friend, confessions, extorted by
      circumstances, degrading and unavailing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your ladyship need not be apprehensive of hearing from me any degrading
      confessions," said Miss Sidney; "I have none to make: and since, without
      any just cause, without any cause for suspicion, but what a blush,
      perhaps, or a moment's embarrassment of manner may have created, you think
      it becomes you to point out to me that the moment for confidence between
      us is past, I can only lament my mistake in having believed that it ever
      existed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary's countenance and manner totally changed. The pride of rank
      yielded before the pride of virtue; and perhaps the hope that she had
      really no cause for suspicion at once restored her affection for her young
      friend. "Let us understand one another, my dear Selina," said she; "if I
      said a hasty or a harsh word, forgive it. You know my affection for you,
      and my real confidence; in actions, not in words, I have shown it.&mdash;In
      thought, as well as in actions, my confidence in you has been entire; for,
      <i>upon my word,</i> and you know this is not an asseveration I lightly
      use, <i>upon my word,</i> till that unfortunate moment, a suspicion of you
      never crossed my imagination. The proof&mdash;if there could need any
      proof to you of what I assert&mdash;the proof is, the delight I take in
      your society, the urgent manner in which I have so frequently, this
      summer, begged your company from your mother. You know this would have not
      only been the height of insincerity, but of folly and madness, if I had
      not felt a reliance upon you that made me consider it as an absolute
      impossibility that you could ever disappoint my friendship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank your ladyship," said Selina, softened by the kind tone in which
      Lady Mary now spoke, yet still retaining some reserve of manner; "I thank
      your ladyship for all your kindness&mdash;it has flattered me much&mdash;touched
      me deeply&mdash;commanded my gratitude, and influenced my conduct
      uniformly&mdash;I can and do entirely forgive the injustice of a moment;
      and I now bid you adieu, my dear Lady Mary, with the conviction that, if
      we were never to meet again, I should always hold that place in your
      esteem and affection with which you have honoured me, and which, if it be
      not too proud an expression, I hope I have deserved&mdash;&mdash;Won't you
      bid me farewell?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears gushed from Lady Mary's eyes. "My dear, charming, and prudent
      Selina, I understand you perfectly&mdash;and I thank you: it grieves me to
      part with you&mdash;but I believe you are right&mdash;I believe there is
      no other safety&mdash;no other remedy. How, indeed, could I expect that my
      son could see and hear you&mdash;live in the house with you, and become
      intimately acquainted with such a character as yours, without danger! I
      have been very imprudent, unaccountably imprudent, to expose him to such a
      temptation; but I hope, I trust, that your prudence will repair, in time,
      the effects of my rashness&mdash;and again and again I thank you, my dear
      young friend&mdash;but, perhaps it might be still better that you should
      not leave us abruptly. Still better than your absence, I think, would be
      the conviction you might impress on his mind of the impossibility of his
      hopes: if you were to stay a day or two, and convince him by your
      indifference that&mdash;&mdash;" "Excuse me, that is what I cannot
      undertake," said Selina, blushing, and conscious of blushing. Lady Mary
      was too polite and too delicate to seem to observe her confusion, but,
      embracing her, said&mdash;"If we must part, then take with you my highest
      esteem, affection, and gratitude; and this much let me add, that my most
      sanguine expectations for my son's happiness would be realized, if amongst
      the women to whom family interests must restrict his choice, he could meet
      with one of half your merit, and half your attractions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Amongst the women to whom family interests must restrict his choice</i>,"
      repeated Selina to herself many times, as she journeyed homewards; and she
      pondered much upon the meaning of this phrase. Vivian was sole heir to a
      very large property, without encumbrances of any kind; what, therefore,
      was the necessity that restricted his choice? The imaginary necessity of
      ambition, which confined him to a certain circle of fashionable, or <i>highly
      connected</i> people. Selina Sidney, though she was not rich, was of a
      very good gentleman's family; her father had been a colonel in the British
      army: during his life, Mrs. Sidney had been in the habit of living a great
      deal in what is called <i>the world,</i> and in the best company; and
      though, since his death, she had lived in retirement, Miss Sidney had
      received an education which put her upon a footing with young ladies of
      the highest accomplishments and refinement in the kingdom. With every
      solid and amiable quality, she had all those external advantages of
      appearance and manner which Lady Mary Vivian valued most highly. Selina,
      who was convinced that Lady Mary appreciated her character, and was
      peculiarly fond of her company and conversation, could not but feel
      surprise, mixed with some indignation, perhaps with a little resentment,
      when she perceived that her ladyship's prejudices and ambition made her
      act so completely in contradiction to her better judgment, to her
      professions, and to her feelings of affection. Whatever Miss Sidney
      thought upon this subject, however, she determined to continue to avoid
      seeing Vivian any more&mdash;an excellent resolution, in which we leave
      her, and return to her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      A walk with Russell had brought him back in the full determination of
      avowing his attachment sincerely to his mother, and of speaking to her
      ladyship in the most respectful manner; but, when he found that Miss
      Sidney was gone, anger and disappointment made him at once forget his
      prudence, and his intended respect; he declared, in the most passionate
      terms, his love for Selina Sidney, and his irrevocable determination to
      pursue her, to the end of time and space, in spite of all opposition
      whatsoever from any person whatever. His mother, who was prepared for a
      scene of this sort, though not for one of this violence, had sufficient
      command of temper to sustain it properly; her command of temper was,
      indeed, a little assisted by the hope that this passion would be
      transitory in proportion to its vehemence, much by the confidence she had
      in Miss Sidney's <i>honour</i>, and in her absence: Lady Mary, therefore,
      calmly disclaimed having had any part in persuading Miss Sidney to that
      measure which had so much enraged her lover; but her ladyship avowed, that
      though it had not been necessary for her to suggest the measure, she
      highly approved of it, and admired now, as she had ever admired, that
      young lady's prudent and noble conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Softened by the only thing that could, at this moment, soften him&mdash;praise
      of his mistress&mdash;Vivian, in a most affectionate manner, assured his
      mother that it was her warm eulogiums of Miss Sidney which had first
      turned his attention to the perfections of her character; and he now
      inquired what possible objections she could make to his choice. With the
      generous enthusiasm of his disposition, heightened by all the eloquence of
      love, he pleaded, that his fortune was surely sufficient to put him above
      mercenary considerations in the choice of a wife; that in every point,
      except this one of <i>money</i>, Selina Sidney was, in his own mother's
      opinion, superior to every other woman she could name, or wish for, as a
      daughter-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But my tastes are not to blind me to your interests," said Lady Mary;
      "you are entitled to look for rank and high connexion. You are the
      representative of an ancient family, have talents to make a figure in
      public; and, in short, prejudice or not, I confess it is one of the first
      wishes of my heart that you should marry into a noble family, or at least
      into one that shall strengthen your political interest, as well as secure
      your domestic happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian, of course, cursed ambition, as all men do whilst they are in love.
      His arguments and his eloquence in favour of a <i>private station</i>, and
      of the joys of <i>learned leisure, a competence, and domestic bliss</i>,
      were worthy of the most renowned of ancient or modern philosophers.
      Russell was appealed to with much eagerness, both by mother and son,
      during their debates. He frankly declared to Lady Mary, that he thought
      her son perfectly right in all he now urged, and especially in his opinion
      of Miss Sidney; "but at the same time," added Russell, "I apprehend that
      he speaks, at this moment, more from passion than from reason; and I fear
      that, in the course of a few months, he might, perhaps, entirely change
      his mind: therefore, I think your ladyship is prudent in refusing, during
      the minority of your son, your consent to a hasty union, of which he might
      afterwards repent, and thus render both himself and a most amiable woman
      miserable."
    </p>
    <p>
      Russell, after having given his opinion with the utmost freedom, when it
      was required by Lady Mary, assured her that he should no farther
      interfere; and he trusted his present sincerity would be the best pledge
      to her of his future discretion and honour. This equitable judgment and
      sincerity of Russell's at first displeased both parties, but in time
      operated upon the reason of both; not, however, before contests had gone
      on long and loud between the mother and son&mdash;not before a great deal
      of nonsense had been talked on both sides. People of the best abilities
      often talk the most nonsense where their passions are concerned, because
      then the whole of their ingenuity is exercised to find arguments in favour
      of their folly. They are not, like fools, content to say, <i>This is my
      will</i>; but they pique themselves on giving reasons for their will; and
      their reasons are the reasons of madmen, excellent upon false premises. It
      happened here, as in most family quarrels, that the disputants did not
      allow sufficiently for the prejudices and errors incident to their
      different ages. The mother would not allow for the romantic notions of the
      son, nor could the son endure the worldly views of the mother. The son,
      who had as yet no experience of the transitory nature of the passion of
      love, thought his mother unfeeling and barbarous, for opposing him on the
      point where the whole happiness of his life was concerned; the mother, who
      had seen the decline and fall of so many <i>everlasting loves</i>,
      considered him only as a person in a fever; and thought she prevented him,
      by her calmness, from doing that which he would repent when he should
      regain his sober senses. Without detailing the daily disputes which now
      arose, it will be sufficient to mark the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian's love had been silent, tranquil, and not seemingly of any great
      consequence, till it was opposed; but, from the instant that an obstacle
      intervened, it gathered strength and force, and it presently rose rapidly,
      with prodigious uproar, threatening to burst all bounds, and to destroy
      every thing that stopped its course. Lady Mary was now inclined to try
      what effect lessening the opposition might produce. To do her justice, she
      was also moved to this by some nobler motives than fear; or, at least, her
      fears were not of a selfish kind: she dreaded that her son's health and
      permanent happiness might be injured by this violent passion; she was
      apprehensive of becoming an object of his aversion; of utterly losing his
      confidence, and all power over his mind; but, chiefly, her generous temper
      was moved and won by Selina Sidney's admirable conduct. During the whole
      time that Vivian used every means to see her, to write to her, and to
      convince her of the fervour of his love, though he won all her friends
      over to his interests, though she heard his praises from morning till
      night from all who surrounded her, and though her own heart, perhaps,
      pleaded more powerfully than all the rest in his favour; yet she never,
      for one instant, gave him the slightest encouragement. Lady Mary's esteem
      and affection were so much increased by these strong proofs of friendship
      and honour, that her prejudices yielded; and she at length declared, that
      if her son continued, till he was of age, to feel the same attachment for
      this amiable girl, she would give her consent to their union. But this,
      she added, she promised only on one condition&mdash;that her son should
      abstain from all attempts, in the interval, to see or correspond with Miss
      Sidney, and that he should set out immediately to travel with Mr. Russell.
      Transported with love, and joy, and victory, Vivian promised every thing
      that was required of him, embraced his mother, and set out upon his
      travels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allow," said he triumphantly to Russell, as the chaise drove from the
      door, "allow, my good friend, that you were mistaken, in your fears of the
      weakness of my character, and of the yielding facility of my temper. You
      see how firm I have been&mdash;you see what battle I have made&mdash;you
      see how I have <i>stood out</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never doubted," said Russell, "your love of your own free will&mdash;I
      never doubted your fear of being governed, especially by your mother; but
      you do not expect that I should allow this to be a proof of strength of
      character."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! do you suppose I act from love of my own free will merely?&mdash;Do
      you call my love for Selina Sidney weakness?&mdash;Oh! take care, Russell;
      for if once I find you pleading my mother's cause against your conscience&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will never find me pleading any cause against my conscience. I have
      told your mother, as I have told you, my opinion of Miss Sidney&mdash;my
      firm opinion&mdash;that she is peculiarly calculated to make the happiness
      of your life, provided you continue to love her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Provided!&mdash;Oh!" cried Vivian, laughing, "spare your musty provisoes,
      my dear philosopher! Would not any one think, now, you were an old man of
      ninety? If this is all you have to fear, I am happy indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At present," said Russell, calmly, "I have no fear, as I have just told
      your mother, but that you should change your mind before you are of age."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian grew quite indignant at this suggestion. "You are angry with me,"
      said Russell, "and so was your mother: she was angry because I said, I <i>feared,</i>
      instead of I <i>hoped,</i> you would change your mind. Both parties are
      angry with me for my sincerity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sincerity!&mdash;no; but I am angry with you for your absurd suspicions
      of my constancy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If they are absurd, you need not be angry," said Russell; "I shall be
      well pleased to see their absurdity demonstrated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I can demonstrate it this moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me; not this moment; you must take time into the account. I make
      no doubt but that, at this moment, you are heartily in love with Miss
      Sidney; but the thing to be proved is, that your passion will not decline
      in force, in proportion as it meets with less resistance. If it does, you
      will acknowledge that it was more a love of your own free will than a love
      of your mistress that has actuated you, which was the thing to be proved."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hateful Q.E.D.!" cried Vivian; "you shall see the contrary, and, at
      least, I will triumph over you."
    </p>
    <p>
      If Russell had ever used art in his management of Vivian's mind, he might
      have been suspected of using it in favour of Miss Sidney at this instant;
      for this prophecy of Vivian's inconstancy was the most likely means to
      prevent its accomplishment. Frequently, in the course of their tour, when
      Vivian was in any situation where his constancy was tempted, he
      recollected Russell's prediction, and was proud to remind him how much he
      had been mistaken. In short, the destined time for their return home
      arrived&mdash;Vivian presented himself before his mother, and claimed her
      promise. She was somewhat surprised, and a little disappointed, by our
      hero's constancy; but she could not retract her word; and, since her
      compliance was now unavoidable, she was determined that it should be
      gracious. She wrote to Selina, therefore, with great kindness, saying,
      that whatever views of other connexions she might formerly have had for
      her son, she had now relinquished them, convinced, by the constancy of her
      son's attachment, and by the merit of its object, that his own choice
      would most effectually ensure his happiness, and that of all his friends.
      Her ladyship added expressions of her regard and esteem, and of the
      pleasure she felt in the thoughts of finding in her daughter-in-law a
      friend and companion, whose society was peculiarly agreeable to her taste
      and suited to her character. This letter entirely dissipated Selina's
      scruples of conscience; Vivian's love and merit, all his good and all his
      agreeable qualities, had now full and unreproved power to work upon her
      tender heart. His generous, open temper, his candour, his warm attachment
      to his friends, his cultivated understanding, his brilliant talents, his
      easy, well-bred, agreeable manners, all heightened in their power to
      please by the charm of love, justified, even in the eyes of the aged and
      prudent, the passion he inspired. Selina became extremely attached to him;
      and she loved with the delightful belief that there was not, in the mind
      of her lover, the seed of a single vice which threatened danger to his
      virtues or to their mutual happiness. With his usual candour, he had laid
      open his whole character to her, as far as he knew it himself; and had
      warned her of that vacillation of temper, that easiness to be led, which
      Russell had pointed out as a dangerous fault in his disposition. But of
      this propensity Selina had seen no symptoms; on the contrary, the
      steadiness of her lover in his attachment to her&mdash;the only point on
      which she had yet seen him tried&mdash;decided her to trust to the
      persuasive voice of love and hope, and to believe that Russell's
      friendship had in this instance, been too harsh or too timorous in its
      forebodings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing now delayed the marriage of Vivian and Selina but certain legal
      rites, which were to be performed on his coming of age, and before
      marriage settlements could be drawn;&mdash;and the parties were doomed to
      wait for the arrival of some trustee who was with his regiment abroad. All
      these delays Vivian of course cursed: but, upon the whole, they were borne
      by him with heroic patience, and by Selina with all the tranquillity of
      confiding love, happy in the present, and not too anxious for the future.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "My dear Russell," said Vivian, "love shall not make me forget friendship;
      before I marry, I must see you provided for. Believe me, this was the
      first&mdash;one of the first pleasures I promised myself, in becoming
      master of a good fortune. Other thoughts, I confess, have put it out of my
      head; so now let me tell you at once. I hate paltry surprises with my
      friends: I have, you know&mdash;or rather, probably, you do not know, for
      you are the most disinterested fellow upon earth&mdash;I have an excellent
      living in my gift; it shall be yours; consider it as such from this
      moment. If I knew a more deserving man, I would give it to him, upon my
      honour; so you can't refuse me. The incumbent can't live long; he is an
      old, very old, infirm man; you'll have the living in a year or two, and,
      in the mean time, stay with me. I ask it as a favour from a friend, and
      you see how much I want a friend of your firm character; and I hope you
      see, also, how much I can value, in others, the qualities in which I am
      myself deficient."
    </p>
    <p>
      Russell was much pleased and touched by Vivian's generous gratitude, and
      by the delicacy, as well as kindness of the manner in which he made this
      offer; but Russell could not consistently with his feelings or his
      principles live in a state of dependent idleness, waiting for a rich
      living and the death of an old incumbent. He told Vivian that he had too
      much affection for him, and too much respect for himself, ever to run the
      hazard of sinking from the rank of an independent friend. After rallying
      him, without effect, on his pride, Vivian acknowledged that he was forced
      to admire him the more for his spirit. Lady Mary, too, who was a great and
      sincere admirer of independence of character, warmly applauded Mr.
      Russell, and recommended him, in the highest terms, to a nobleman in the
      neighbourhood, who happened to be in want of a preceptor for his only son.
      This nobleman was Lord Glistonbury: his lordship was eager to engage a
      person of Russell's reputation for talents; so the affair was quickly
      arranged, and Lady Mary Vivian and her son went to pay a morning visit at
      Glistonbury Castle, on purpose to accompany Russell on his first
      introduction to the family. As they approached the castle, Vivian was
      struck with its venerable Gothic appearance; he had not had a near view of
      it for some years, and he looked at it with new eyes. Formerly he had seen
      it only as a picturesque ornament to the country; but now that he was
      himself possessor of an estate in the vicinity, he considered Glistonbury
      Castle as a point of comparison which rendered him dissatisfied with his
      own mansion. As he drove up the avenue, and beheld the towers, turrets,
      battlements, and massive entrance, his mother, who was a woman of taste,
      strengthened, by her exclamations on the beauty of Gothic architecture,
      the wish that was rising in his mind to convert his modern house into an
      <i>ancient</i> castle: she could not help sighing whilst she reflected
      that, if her son's affections had not been engaged, he might perhaps have
      obtained the heart and hand of one of the fair daughters of this castle.
      Lady Mary went no farther, even in her inmost thoughts. Incapable of
      double-dealing, she resolved never even to let her son know what her
      wishes had been with respect to a connexion with the Glistonbury family.
      But the very reserve and <i>discretion</i> with which her ladyship spoke&mdash;a
      reserve unusual with her, and unsuited to the natural warmth of her manner
      and temper&mdash;might have betrayed her to an acute and cool observer.
      Vivian, however, at this instant, was too much intent upon castle-building
      to admit any other ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the carriage drove under the great gateway and stopped, Vivian
      exclaimed, "What a fine old castle! how surprised Selina Sidney would be,
      how delighted, to see my house metamorphosed into such a castle!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a magnificent castle, indeed!" said Lady Mary, with a sigh: "I
      think there are the Lady Lidhursts on the terrace; and here comes my Lord
      Glistonbury with his son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My pupil?" said Russell; "I hope the youth is such as I can become
      attached to. Life would be wretched indeed without attachment&mdash;of
      some sort or other. But I must not expect," added he, "to find a second
      time a friend in a pupil; and such a friend!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sentiment, or the expression of the tenderness he felt for his friends,
      was so unusual from Russell, that it had double effect; and Vivian was so
      much struck by it, that he could scarcely collect his thoughts in time to
      speak to Lord Glistonbury, who came to receive his guests, attended by
      three <i>hangers on</i> of the family&mdash;a chaplain, a captain, and a
      young lawyer. His lordship was scarcely past the meridian of life; yet, in
      spite of his gay and debonair manner, he looked old, as if he were paying
      for the libertinism of his youth by premature decrepitude. His countenance
      announced pretensions to ability; his easy and affable address, and the
      facility with which he expressed himself, gained him credit at first for
      much more understanding than he really possessed. There was a plausibility
      in all he said; but, if it were examined, there was nothing in it but
      nonsense. Some of his expressions appeared brilliant; some of his
      sentiments just; but there was a want of consistency, a want of a
      pervading mind in his conversation, which to good judges betrayed the
      truth, that all his opinions were adopted, not formed; all his maxims
      commonplace; his wit mere repetition; his sense merely <i>tact</i>. After
      proper thanks and compliments to Lady Mary and Mr. Vivian, for securing
      for him such a treasure as Mr. Russell, he introduced Lord Lidhurst, a
      sickly, bashful boy of fourteen, to his new governor, with polite
      expressions of unbounded confidence, and a rapid enunciation of undefined
      and contradictory expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Russell will, I am perfectly persuaded, make Lidhurst every thing we
      can desire," said his lordship; "an honour to his country, an ornament to
      his family. It is my decided opinion that man is but a bundle of habits;
      and it's my maxim, that education is <i>second</i> nature&mdash;<i>first</i>,
      indeed, in many cases. For, except that I am staggered about original
      genius, I own I conceive with Hartley, that early impressions and
      associations are all in all: his vibrations and vibratiuncles are quite
      satisfactory. But what I particularly wish for Lidhurst, sir, is, that he
      should be trained as soon as possible into a statesman. Mr. Vivian, I
      presume you mean to follow up public business, and no doubt will make a
      figure. So I prophesy; and I am used to these things. And from Lidhurst,
      too, under similar tuition, I may with reason expect miracles&mdash;'hope
      to hear him thundering in the house of commons in a few years&mdash;'confess
      'am not quite so impatient to have the young dog in the house of
      incurables; for you know he could not be there without being in my shoes,
      which I have not done with yet&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;&mdash;Each in his
      turn, my boy! In the mean time, Lady Mary, shall we join the ladies
      yonder, on the terrace? Lady Glistonbury walks so slow, that she will be
      seven hours in coming to us; so we had best go to her ladyship: if the
      mountain won't go to Mahomet&mdash;you know, of course, what follows."
    </p>
    <p>
      On their way to the terrace, Lord Glistonbury, who always heard himself
      speak with singular complacency, continued to give his ideas on education;
      sometimes appealing to Mr. Russell, sometimes happy to catch the eye of
      Lady Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, my idea for Lidhurst is simply this:&mdash;that he should know every
      thing that is in all the best books in the library, but yet that he should
      be the farthest possible from a book-worm&mdash;that he should never,
      except in a set speech in the house, have the air of having opened a book
      in his life&mdash;mother-wit for me!&mdash;in most cases&mdash;and that
      easy style of originality, which shows the true gentleman. As to morals&mdash;Lidhurst,
      walk on, my boy&mdash;as to morals, I confess I couldn't bear to see any
      thing of the Joseph Surface about him. A youth of spirit must, you know,
      Mr. Vivian&mdash;excuse me, Lady Mary, this is&mdash;<i>an aside</i>&mdash;be
      something of a latitudinarian to keep in the fashion: not that I mean to
      say so exactly to Lidhurst&mdash;no, no&mdash;on the contrary, Mr.
      Russell, it is our cue, as well as this reverend gentleman's," looking
      back at the chaplain, who bowed assent before he knew to what, "it is our
      cue, as well as this reverend gentleman's, to preach prudence, and
      temperance, and all the cardinal virtues."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Cardinal</i> virtues! very good, faith! my lord," said the lawyer,
      looking at the clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Temperance!</i>" repeated the chaplain, winking at the officer; "upon
      my soul, my lord, that's too bad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Prudence!</i>" repeated the captain; "that's too clean a cut at poor
      Wicksted, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before his lordship had time to preach any more prudence, they arrived
      within bowing distance of the ladies, who had, indeed, advanced at a very
      slow rate. Vivian was not acquainted with any of the ladies of the
      Glistonbury family; for they had, till this summer, resided at another of
      their country seats, in a distant county. His mother had often met them at
      parties in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Glistonbury was a thin, stiffened, flattened figure&mdash;she was
      accompanied by two other female forms, one old, the other young; not each
      a different grace, but alike all three in angularity, and in a cold
      haughtiness of mien. After reconnoitring with their glasses the party of
      gentlemen, these ladies quickened their step; and Lady Glistonbury, making
      her countenance as affable as it was in its nature to be, exclaimed, "My
      dear Lady Mary Vivian! have I the pleasure to see your ladyship?&mdash;They
      told me it was only visitors to my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vivian had then the honour of being introduced to her ladyship, to her
      eldest daughter, Lady Sarah Lidhurst, and to Miss Strictland, the
      governess. By all of these ladies he was most graciously received; but
      poor Russell was not so fortunate; nothing could be more cold and
      repulsive than their reception of him. This did not make Lady Sarah appear
      very agreeable to Vivian; he thought her, at this first view, one of the
      least attractive young women he had ever beheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is my Julia?" inquired Lord Glistonbury. "Ah! there she goes
      yonder, all life and spirits."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian looked as his lordship directed his eye, and saw, at the farthest
      end of the terrace, a young girl of about fifteen, running very fast, with
      a hoop, which she was keeping up with great dexterity for the amusement of
      a little boy who was with her. The governess no sooner saw this than she
      went in pursuit of her young ladyship, calling after her, in various tones
      and phrases of reprehension, in French, Italian, and English; and asking
      whether this was a becoming employment for a young lady of her age and
      rank. Heedless of these reproaches, Lady Julia still ran on, away from her
      governess, "to chase the rolling circle's speed," down the slope of the
      terrace; thither Miss Strictland dared not pursue, but contented herself
      with standing on the brink, reiterating her remonstrances. At length the
      hoop fell, and the young lady returned, not to her governess, but, running
      lightly up the slope of the terrace, to her surprise, she came full in
      view of the company before she was aware that any strangers were there.
      Her straw hat being at the back of her head, Lady Glistonbury, with an
      indignant look, pulled it forwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a beautiful colour! what a sweet countenance Lady Julia has!"
      whispered Lady Mary Vivian to Lord Glistonbury: at the same time she could
      not refrain from glancing her eyes towards her son, to see what effect was
      produced upon him. Vivian's eyes met hers; and this single look of his
      mother's revealed to him all that she had, in her great prudence, resolved
      to conceal. He smiled at her, and then at Russell, as much as to say,
      "Surely there can be no comparison between such a child as this and Selina
      Sidney!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes afterwards, in consequence of a sign from Lady Glistonbury,
      Julia disappeared with her governess; and the moment was unnoticed by
      Vivian, who was then, as his mother observed, looking up at one of the
      turrets of the old castle. All its inhabitants were at this time
      uninteresting to him, except so far as they regarded his friend Russell;
      but the castle itself absorbed his attention. Lord Glistonbury, charmed to
      see how he was struck by it, offered to show him over every part of the
      edifice; an offer which he and Lady Mary gladly accepted. Lady Glistonbury
      excused herself, professing to be unable to sustain the fatigue: she
      deputed her eldest daughter to attend Lady Mary in her stead; and this was
      the only circumstance which diminished the pleasure to Vivian, for he was
      obliged to show due courtesy to this stiff taciturn damsel at every turn,
      whilst he was intent upon seeing the architecture of the castle, and the
      views from the windows of the towers and loop-holes of the galleries; all
      which Lady Sarah pointed out with a cold, ceremonious civility, and a
      formal exactness of proceeding, which enraged Vivian's enthusiastic
      temper. The visit ended: he railed half the time he was going home against
      their fair, or, as he called her, their petrified guide; then, full of the
      Gothic beauties of Glistonbury, he determined, as soon as possible, to
      turn his own modern house into a castle. The very next morning he had an
      architect to view it, and to examine its capabilities. It happened that,
      about this time, several of the noblemen and gentry, in the county in
      which Vivian resided, had been seized with this rage for turning
      comfortable houses into uninhabitable castles. And, however perverse or
      impracticable this retrograde movement in architecture might seem, there
      were always at hand professional projectors, to convince gentlemen that
      nothing was so feasible. Provided always that gentlemen approve their
      estimates as well as their plans, they undertake to carry buildings back,
      in a trice, two, or three, or half a dozen centuries, as may be required,
      to make them Gothic or Saracenic, and to "add every grace that time alone
      can give." A few days after Vivian had been at Glistonbury Castle, when
      Lord Glistonbury came to return the visit, Russell, who accompanied his
      lordship, found his friend encompassed with plans and elevations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely, my dear Vivian," said he, seizing the first moment he could speak
      to him, "you are not going to spoil this excellent house? It is completely
      finished, in handsome modern architecture, perfectly comfortable and
      convenient, light, airy, large enough, warm rooms, well distributed, with
      ample means of getting at each apartment; and if you set about to
      new-model and transform it into a castle, you must, I see, by your plan,
      alter the proportions of almost every room, and spoil the comfort of the
      whole; turn square to round, and round again to square; and, worse than
      all, turn light to darkness&mdash;only for the sake of having what is
      called a castle, but what has not, in fact, any thing of the grandeur or
      solid magnificence of a real ancient edifice. These modern baby-house
      miniatures of castles, which gentlemen ruin themselves to build, are,
      after all, the most paltry, absurd things imaginable."
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Vivian was, after some dispute, forced to agree; but he said,
      "that his should not be a baby-house; that he would go to any expense to
      make it really magnificent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As magnificent, I suppose, as Glistonbury Castle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If possible:&mdash;that is, I confess, the object of my emulation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Russell, shaking his head, "these are the objects of emulation,
      for which country gentlemen often ruin themselves; barter their
      independence and real respectability; reduce themselves to distress and
      disgrace: these are the objects for which they sell either their estates
      or their country; become placemen or beggars; and end either in the
      liberties of the King's Bench, or the slaveries of St. James's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible for me! you know my public principles," said Vivian: "and you
      know that I think the life of an independent country gentleman the most
      respectable of all others&mdash;you know my principles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know your facility," said Russell: "if you begin by sacrificing thus to
      your taste, do you think you will not end by sacrificing to your
      interest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never! never!" cried Vivian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you imagine that a strong temptation will not act where a weak one
      has been found irresistible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of this I am certain," said Vivian: "I could never be brought to sell my
      country, or to forfeit my honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps not," said Russell: "you might, in your utmost need, have another
      alternative; you might forfeit your love; you might give up Selina Sidney,
      and marry for money&mdash;all for the sake of a castle!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Struck by this speech, Vivian exclaimed, "I would give up a thousand
      castles rather than run such a hazard!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us then coolly calculate," said Russell. "What would the castle cost
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The expense, even by the estimates of the architects, which, in the
      execution, are usually doubled, was enormous, such as Vivian acknowledged
      was unsuited even to his ample fortune. His fortune, though considerable,
      was so entailed, that he would, if he exceeded his income, be soon reduced
      to difficulties for ready money. But then his mother had several thousands
      in the stocks, which she was ready to lend him to forward this
      castle-building. It was a project which pleased her taste, and gratified
      her aristocratic notions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian assured his friend at parting, that his reason was convinced: that
      he would not yield to the whims of taste, and that he would prudently give
      up his folly. So he determined; and he abided by his determination till he
      heard numbers speak on the other side of the question. With Vivian, those
      who spoke last frequently seemed to speak best; and, in general, the
      number of voices overpowered the weight of argument. By the persuasions of
      his mother, the example of his neighbours, and the urgency of architects
      and men of taste who got about him soon afterwards, he was convinced that
      there was no living without a castle, and that the expense would be <i>next
      to nothing at all. Convinced</i>, we should not say; for he yielded,
      against his conviction, from mere want of power to resist reiterated
      solicitations. He had no other motive; for the enthusiasm raised by the
      view of Glistonbury Castle had passed away: he plainly saw, what Russell
      had pointed out to him, that he should spoil the inside of his house for
      the sake of the outside; and, for his own part, he preferred comfort to
      show. It was not, therefore, to please his own taste that he ran into this
      imprudent expense, but merely to gratify the taste of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the bustle of building began, and workmen swarmed round his house; the
      foundations sank, the scaffolds rose; and many times did Vivian sigh and
      repent, when he saw how much was to be undone before any thing could be
      done; when he found his house dismantled, saw the good ceilings and
      elegant cornices knocked to pieces, saw the light domes and modern sashes
      give way; all taken out to be replaced, at profuse expense, by a clumsy
      imitation of Gothic; how often did be sigh and calculate, when he saw the
      tribes of workmen file off as their dinner bell rang! how often did he
      bless himself, when he beheld the huge beams of timber dragged into his
      yards, and the solid masses of stone brought from a quarry at an enormous
      distance!&mdash;Vivian perceived that the expense would be treble the
      estimate; and said, that if the thing were to be done again, he would
      never consent to it; but now, as Lady Mary observed, it was too late to
      repent; and it was, at any rate, best to go on and finish it with spirit&mdash;since
      it was impossible (nobody knew why) to stop. He hurried on the workmen
      with impatience; for he was anxious to have the roof and some apartments
      in his castle finished before his marriage. The dilatoriness of the
      lawyers, and the want of the trustee, who had not yet arrived in England,
      were no longer complained of so grievously by the lover. Russell, one day,
      as he saw Vivian overlooking his workmen, and urging them to expedition,
      smiled, and asked whether the impatience of an architect or of a lover was
      now predominant in his mind. Vivian, rather offended by the question,
      replied, that his eagerness to finish this part of his castle arose from
      his desire to give an agreeable surprise to his bride; and he declared
      that his passion for Selina was as ardent, at this moment, as it had ever
      been; but that it was impossible to make lawyers move faster than their
      accustomed pace; and that Miss Sidney was too secure of his affection, and
      he too well convinced of hers, to feel that sort of anxiety, which persons
      who had less confidence in each other might experience in similar
      circumstances. This was all very true, and very reasonable; but Russell
      could not help perceiving that Vivian's language and tone were somewhat
      altered since the time when he was ready to brave heaven and earth to
      marry his mistress, without license or consent of friends, without the
      possibility of waiting a few months till he was of age. In fact, though
      Vivian would not allow it, this consent of friends, this ceasing of
      opposition, this security and tranquillity of happiness, had considerably
      changed the appearance, at least, of his love. Lady Mary perceived it,
      with a resolution to say nothing, and see how it would end. Selina did not
      perceive it for some time; for she was of a most unsuspicious temper; and
      her confidence in Vivian was equal to the fondness of her love. She began
      to think, indeed, that the lawyers were provokingly slow; and when Vivian
      did not blame them as much as he used to do, she only thought that he
      understood business better than she did&mdash;besides, the necessary
      trustee was not come&mdash;and, in short, the last thing that occurred to
      her mind was to blame Vivian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trustee at length arrived, and the castle was almost in the wished-for
      state of forwardness, when a new cause of delay arose&mdash;a county
      election: but how this election was brought on, and how it was conducted,
      it is necessary to record. It happened that a relation of Vivian's was
      appointed to a new seventy-four gun ship, of which he came to take the
      command at Yarmouth, which was within a few miles of him. Vivian
      recollected that Russell had often expressed a desire to go on board a
      man-of-war. Vivian, therefore, after having appointed a day for their
      going, went to Glistonbury to invite Russell: his pupil, Lord Lidhurst,
      begged to be permitted to accompany them: and Lady Julia, the moment she
      heard of this new seventy-four gun ship, was, as her governess expressed
      it, wild to be of the party. Indeed, any thing that had the name of a
      party of pleasure, and that promised a transient relief from the tedious
      monotony in which her days passed; any thing that gave a chance of even a
      few hours' release from the bondage in which she was held between the
      restraints of the most rigid of governesses and the proudest of mothers,
      appeared delightful to this lively and childish girl. She persecuted her
      governess with entreaties, till at last she made Miss Strictland go with
      her petition to Lady Glistonbury; whilst, in the mean time, Lady Julia
      overwhelmed her father with caresses, till he consented; and with much
      difficulty, prevailed upon Lady Glistonbury to give her permission for the
      young ladies to go with their governess, their brother, their father, and
      Lady Mary Vivian, on this excursion. The invitation was now extended to
      all the company then at the castle; including the representative of the
      county, who, being just threatened with a fit of the gout, brought on by
      hard drinking at the last election, expressed some reluctance to going
      with this party on the water. But this gentleman was now paying his humble
      devoirs to the Lady Sarah Lidhurst; and it was represented to him, by all
      who understood the ground, that he would give mortal offence if he did not
      go; so it was ruled, that, hot or cold, gout or no gout, he must appear in
      the Lady Sarah's train: he submitted to this perilous necessity in the
      most gallant manner. The day proved tolerably fine&mdash;Vivian had an
      elegant entertainment provided for the company, under a marquee pitched on
      the shore&mdash;they <i>embarked</i> in a pleasure-boat&mdash;Lady Sarah
      was very sick, and her admirer very cold; but Lady Julia was in extasies
      at every thing she saw and felt&mdash;she feared nothing, found nothing
      inconvenient&mdash;was charmed to be drawn so easily from the boat up the
      high side of the ship&mdash;charmed to find herself on deck&mdash;charmed
      to see the sails, the ropes, the rigging, the waves, the sea, the sun, the
      clouds, the sailors, the cook dressing dinner&mdash;all, all
      indiscriminately charmed her; and, like a school-girl broke loose, she ran
      about, wild with spirits, asking questions, some sensible, some silly;
      laughing at her own folly, flying from this side to that, from one end of
      the ship to the other, down the ladders and up again; whilst Mr. Russell,
      who was deputed to take care of her, could scarcely keep up with her: Lord
      Glistonbury stood by, holding his sides and laughing aloud: Miss
      Strictland, quite disabled by the smell of the ship, was lying on a bed in
      the state cabin; and Lady Sarah, all the time shaded by an umbrella held
      by her shivering admirer, sat, as if chained upright in her chair of
      state, upon deck, scorning her sister's childish levity, and proving
      herself, with all due propriety, incapable of being moved to surprise or
      admiration by any object on land or sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary Vivian, while she observed with a quick eye all that passed, and
      read her son's thoughts, was fully persuaded that neither of the Lady
      Lidhursts would be likely to suit his taste, even if his affections were
      disengaged: the one was too childish, the other too stiff. "Yet their
      birth and connexions, and their consequence in the county," thought Lady
      Mary, "would have made their alliance highly desirable." Every body seemed
      weary at the close of this day's entertainment, except Lady Julia, who <i>kept
      it up</i> with indefatigable gaiety, and could hardly believe that it was
      time to go home, when the boat was announced to row them to shore:
      heedless, and absolutely dizzy with talking and laughing, her ladyship,
      escaping from the assistance of sailors and gentlemen, made a false step
      in getting into the boat, and, falling over, would have sunk for ever, but
      for Mr. Russell's presence of mind. He seized her with a strong grasp, and
      saved her. The fright sobered her completely; and she sat wrapped in
      great-coats, as silent, as tractable, and as wet as possible, during the
      remainder of the way to shore. The screams, the ejaculations, the
      reprimands from Miss Strictland; the questions, the reflections, to which
      this incident led, may possibly be conceived, but cannot be enumerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      This event, however alarming at the moment, had no serious consequence;
      for Lady Julia caught neither fever nor cold, though Miss Strictland was
      morally certain her ladyship would have one or the other; indeed she
      insinuated, that her ladyship deserved to have both. Lady Sarah's poor
      shivering knight of the shire, however, did not escape so well. Obliged to
      row home, in a damp evening, without his great-coat, which he had been
      forced to offer to Lady Julia, in a pleasure-boat, when he should have
      been in flannels or in bed, he had "cause to rue the boating of that day."
      His usual panacea of the gout did not come as expected, <i>to set him up
      again</i>. The cold he caught this day killed him. Lady Sarah Lidhurst was
      precisely as sorry as decorum required. But the bustle of a new election
      was soon to obliterate the memory of the old member, in the minds of his
      numerous friends. Lord Glistonbury, and several other voices in the
      county, called upon Vivian to stand on the independent interest. There was
      to be a contest: for a government candidate declared himself at the same
      moment that application was made to Vivian. The expense of a contested
      election alarmed both Vivian and his mother. Gratified as she was by the
      honour of this offer, yet she had the prudence to advise her son rather to
      go into parliament as representative for a borough than to hazard the
      expense of a contest for the county. Miss Sidney, also, whom he consulted
      upon this occasion, supported his mother's prudent advice, in the most
      earnest manner; and Vivian was inclined to follow this counsel, till Lord
      Glistonbury came one morning to plead the contrary side of the question:
      he assured Vivian, that from his experience of the county, he was morally
      certain they should carry it without trouble, and with no expense <i>worth
      mentioning</i>. These were only general phrases, to be sure, not
      arguments; but these, joined to her ambition to see her son member for the
      county, at length overpowered Lady Mary's better judgment: her urgent
      entreaties were now joined to those of Lord Glistonbury, and of many
      loud-tongued electioneerers, who proved to Vivian, by every thing but
      calculation, that he must be returned if he would but stand&mdash;if he
      would only declare himself. Russell and his own prudence strongly
      counselled him to resist these clamorous importunities; the two preceding
      candidates, whose fortunes had been nearly as good as his, had been ruined
      by the contests. Vivian was very young, but just of age; and Russell
      observed, "that it would be better for him to see something more of the
      world, before he should embark in politics, and plunge into public
      business." "True," said Vivian; "but Mr. Pitt was only three-and-twenty
      when he was minister of England. I am not ambitious; but I should
      certainly like to distinguish myself, if I could; and whilst I feel in
      youth the glow of patriotism, why should I not serve my country?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Serve it and welcome," said Russell: "but don't begin by ruining yourself
      by a contested election; or else, whatever glow of patriotism you may
      feel, it will be out of your power to be an honest member of parliament.
      If you must go into parliament immediately for the good of your country,
      go in as member for some borough, which will not ruin you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the committee of our friends will be so disappointed if I decline;
      and my mother, who has now set her heart upon it, and Lord Glistonbury,
      and Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, and Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;, and Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;,
      who are such zealous friends, and who urge me so much&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Judge for yourself," said Russell, "and don't let any persons who happen
      to be near you persuade you to see with their eyes, and decide with their
      wishes. Zealous friends, indeed!&mdash;because they love to make
      themselves of consequence, by bawling and scampering about at an election!&mdash;And
      you would let such people draw you on, to ruin yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will show you that they shall not," cried Vivian, seizing a sheet of
      paper, and sitting down immediately to write the copy of a circular letter
      to his friends, informing them, with many thanks, that he declined to
      stand for the county. Russell eagerly wrote copies of this letter, which
      Vivian declared should be sent early the next morning. But no sooner was
      Russell out of sight than Lady Mary Vivian resumed her arguments in favour
      of commencing his canvass immediately, and before his friends should cool.
      When she saw the letters that he had been writing, she was excessively
      indignant; and, by a torrent of female and maternal eloquence, he was
      absolutely overwhelmed. Auxiliaries poured in to her ladyship on all
      sides; horsemen after horsemen, freeholders of all degrees, now flocked to
      the house, hearing that Mr. Vivian had thoughts of standing for the
      county. They were unanimously loud in their assurances of success. Old and
      new copies of poll books were produced, and the different interests of the
      county counted and recounted, balanced and counterbalanced, again and
      again, by each person, after his own fashion: and it was proved to Mr.
      Vivian, <i>in black and white, and as plain as figures could make it</i>,
      that he had the game in his own hands; and that, if he would but declare
      himself, the other candidate would, the very next day, they would be bound
      for it, decline the contest. Vivian had a clear head, and a competent
      knowledge of arithmetic; he saw the fallacies and inaccuracies in their
      modes of computation; he saw, upon examining the books, that the state of
      the county interests was very different from what they pretended or
      believed; and he was convinced that the opposite candidate would not
      decline: but after Vivian had stated these reasons ten times, and his
      mother and his electioneering partisans had reiterated their assertions
      twenty times, he yielded, merely because they had said twice as much as he
      had, and because, poor easy man! he had not power to resist continuity of
      solicitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He declared himself candidate for the county; and was soon immersed in all
      the toil, trouble, vexation, and expense, of a contested election. Of
      course, his marriage was now to be postponed till the election should be
      over. Love and county politics have little affinity. What the evils of a
      contested election are can be fully known only to those by whom they have
      been personally experienced. The contest was bitter. The Glistonbury
      interest was the strongest which supported Vivian: Lord Glistonbury and <i>his
      lordship's friends</i> were warm in his cause. Not that they had any
      particular regard for Vivian; but he was to be <i>their member</i>,
      opposed to the court candidate, whom his lordship was anxious to keep out
      of the county. Lord Glistonbury had once been a strong friend to
      government, and was thought a confirmed courtier, especially as he had
      been brought up in high aristocratic notions; but he had made it his great
      object to turn his earldom into a marquisate; and government having
      delayed or refused to gratify him in this point, he quitted them with
      disgust, and set up his standard amongst the opposition. He was now loud
      and zealous on every occasion that could, as he said, <i>annoy</i>
      government; and merely because he could not be a marquis, he became a
      patriot. Mistaken, abused name! how glorious in its original, how
      despicable in its debased signification!&mdash;Lord Glistonbury's
      exertions were indefatigable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian felt much gratitude for this apparently disinterested friendship;
      and, during a few weeks, whilst this canvass was going on, he formed a
      degree of intimacy with the Glistonbury family, which, in any other
      circumstances, could scarcely have been brought about during months or
      years. An election, in England, seems, for the time, to level all
      distinctions, not only of rank, but even of pride: Lady Glistonbury
      herself, at this season, found it necessary to relax from her usual
      rigidity.&mdash;There was an extraordinary freedom of egress and regress;
      and the haughty code of Glistonbury lay dormant. Vivian, of course, was
      the centre of all interest; and, whenever he appeared, every individual of
      the family was eager to inquire, "What news?&mdash;What news?&mdash;How do
      things go on to-day?&mdash;How will the election turn out?&mdash;Have you
      written to Mr. Such-a-one?&mdash;Have you been to Mr. Such-a-one's?&mdash;I'll
      write a note for you&mdash;I'll copy a letter."&mdash;There was one common
      cause&mdash;Miss Strictland even deigned to assist Mr. Vivian, and to try
      her awkward hand to forward his canvass, for it was to support the
      Glistonbury interest; and "there was no impropriety could attach to the
      thing." Russell's extreme anxiety made Vivian call more frequently even
      than it was necessary at the castle, to quiet his apprehensions, and to
      assure him that things were going on well. Young Lord Lidhurst, who was
      really good-natured, and over whose mind Russell began to gain some
      ascendancy, used to stand upon the watch for Vivian's appearance, and
      would run up the back stairs to Russell's apartment, to give him notice of
      it, and to be the first to tell the news. Lady Sarah&mdash;the icy lady
      Sarah herself&mdash;began to thaw; and every day, in the same phrase, she
      condescended to say to Mr. Vivian, that she "hoped the poll was going on
      as well as could be expected." It was, of course, reported, that Vivian
      was to succeed the late representative of the county in all its honours.
      In eight days he was confidently given to Lady Sarah by the generous
      public; and the day of their nuptials was positively fixed. As the lady
      was, even by the account of her friends, two or three years older than Mr.
      Vivian, and four or five years older by her looks, and as she was
      peculiarly unsuited to his taste, he heard the report without the
      slightest apprehension for his own constancy to Selina. He laughed at the
      idea, as an excellent joke, when it was first mentioned to him by Russell.
      Lord Glistonbury's manners, however, and the cordial familiarity with
      which he treated Vivian, gave every day increasing credit to the report.
      "If he were his son, my lord could not be more anxious about Mr. Vivian,"
      said one of the plain-spoken freeholders, in the presence of the Lady
      Lidhursts.&mdash;Lady Sarah pursed up her mouth, and threw back her head;
      but Lady Julia, archly looking at her sister, smiled. The vivacity of Lady
      Julia's manner did not appear excessive during this election time, when
      all the world seemed mad; on the contrary, there was, in her utmost
      freedom and raillery, that air of good-breeding and politeness, in which
      vulgar mirth and liberty are always deficient. Vivian began to think that
      she was become less childish, and that there was something of a mixture of
      womanish timidity in her appearance, which rendered her infinitely more
      attractive. One evening, in particular, when her father having sent her
      for her morning's work, she returned with a basket full of <i>the Vivian
      cockade</i>, which she had made with her own delicate hands, Vivian
      thought she looked "very pretty:" her father desired her to give them to
      the person for whom they were intended, and she presented them to Mr.
      Russell, saying, "They are for your friend, sir."&mdash;Vivian thought she
      looked "very graceful."&mdash;Lady Mary Vivian suppressed half a sigh, and
      thought she kept the whole of her mind to herself. These happy days of
      canvassing, and this <i>freedom of election</i>, could not last for ever.
      After polling the county to the last freeholder, the contest was at length
      decided, and Vivian was declared duly elected. He was chaired, and he
      scattered money with a lavish hand, as he passed over the heads of the
      huzzaing populace; and he had all the honours of an election: the horses
      were taken from his carriage, and he was drawn by men, who were soon
      afterwards so much intoxicated, that they retained no vestige of
      rationality. Not only the inferior, but the superior rank of electors, as
      usual upon such occasions, thought proper to do honour to their choice,
      and to their powers of judgment, by drinking their member's health at the
      expense of their own, till they could neither see, hear, nor understand.
      Our hero was not by any means fond of drinking, but he could not refuse to
      do as others did; and Lord Glistonbury swore, that now he had found out
      that Vivian could be such a pleasant companion over a bottle, he should
      never listen to his excuses in future.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after this election, parliament met for the dispatch of
      business; and as some important question was to come on, all the members
      were summoned, by a peremptory call of the house. Vivian was obliged to go
      to town immediately, and compelled to defer his marriage. He regretted
      being thus hurried away from Selina; and with a thousand tender and
      passionate expressions, assured her, that the moment his attendance on
      public business could be spared, he should hasten to the country to claim
      his promised happiness. The castle would be finished by the time the
      session was over; the lawyers would also have completed their settlements;
      and Vivian said he should make every other necessary preparation whilst he
      was in town: therefore he urged Selina now to fix the time for their
      marriage, and to let it be the first week of the recess of parliament. But
      Miss Sidney, who had great delicacy of feeling and dignity of character,
      thought that Vivian had of late shown some symptoms of decreased
      affection, and that he had betrayed signs of unsteadiness of character. In
      the whole affair of the castle-building and of the election, he had
      evidently been led by others instead of following his own conviction:&mdash;she
      wisely dreaded that he might, in more important actions, yield his
      judgment to others; and then what security could she have for his
      principles? He might, perhaps, be led into all sorts of fashionable
      dissipation and vice. Besides these fears, she considered that Vivian was
      the possessor of a large fortune; that his mother had with difficulty
      consented to this match; that he was very young, had seen but little of
      the world, and might, perhaps, in future, repent of having made, thus
      early in life, a <i>love match</i>. She therefore absolutely refused to
      let him now bind himself to her by any fresh promises. She desired that he
      should consider himself as perfectly at liberty, and released from all
      engagement to her. It was evident, however, from the manner in which she
      spoke that she wished to restore her lover's liberty for his sake only;
      and that her own feelings, however they might be suppressed, were
      unchanged. Vivian was touched and charmed by her delicacy and generosity:
      in the fervour of his feelings he swore that his affections could never
      change; and he believed what he swore. Lady Mary Vivian was struck, also,
      with Miss Sidney's conduct at parting; and she acknowledged that it was
      impossible to show at once more tenderness and dignity. No one, however,
      not even Vivian, knew how much pain this separation gave Selina. Her good
      sense and prudence told her indeed, that it was best, both for her
      happiness and Vivian's, that he should see something more of the world,
      and that she should have some farther proof of the steadiness of his
      attachment, before she should unite herself with him irrevocably: but
      whilst she endeavoured to fortify her mind with these reflections, love
      inspired many painful fears; and, though she never repented having set him
      free from his promises and engagements, she trembled for the consequences
      of his being thus at liberty, in such scenes of temptation as a London
      life would present.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When our hero arrived in London, and when he was first introduced into
      fashionable society, his thoughts were so intent upon Selina Sidney, that
      he was in no danger of plunging into dissipation. He was surprised at the
      eagerness with which some young men pursued frivolous pleasures: he was
      still more astonished at seeing the apathy in which others of his own age
      were sunk, and the listless insignificance in which they lounged away
      their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The call of the house, which brought Vivian to town, brought Lord
      Glistonbury also to attend his duty in the house of peers: with his
      lordship's family came Mr. Russell, whom Vivian went to see, as soon and
      as often as he could. Russell heard, with satisfaction, the indignant
      eloquence with which his friend spoke; and only wished that these
      sentiments might last, and that fashion might never lead him to imitate or
      to tolerate fools, whom he now despised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the mean time, tell me how you go on yourself," said Vivian; "how do
      you like your situation here, and your pupil, and all the Glistonbury
      family? Let me behind the scenes at once; for, you know, I see them only
      on the stage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Russell replied, in general terms, that he had hopes Lord Lidhurst would
      turn out well, and that therefore he was satisfied with his situation; but
      avoided entering into particulars, because he was a confidential person in
      the family. He thought that a preceptor and a physician were, in some
      respects, bound, by a similar species of honour, to speak cautiously of
      the maladies of their patients, or the faults of their pupils. Admitted
      into the secrets of families, they should never make use of the confidence
      reposed in them, to the disadvantage of any by whom they are trusted.
      Russell's strictly honourable reserve upon this occasion was rather
      provoking to Vivian, who, to all his questions, could obtain only the dry
      answer of&mdash;"Judge for yourself."&mdash;The nature of a town life, and
      the sort of intercourse which capital cities afford, put this very little
      in Vivian's power. The obligations he was under to Lord Glistonbury for
      assistance at the election made him anxious to show his lordship respect
      and attention; and the sort of intimacy which that election had brought on
      was, to a certain degree, kept up in town. Lady Mary Vivian was constantly
      one at Lady Glistonbury's card parties; and Vivian was frequently at his
      lordship's dinners. Considering the coldness and formality of Lady
      Glistonbury's manners, she was particularly attentive to Lady Mary Vivian;
      and our hero was continually an attendant upon the ladies of the
      Glistonbury family to all public places. This was by no means disagreeable
      to him, as they were persons of <i>high consideration</i>; and they were
      sure of drawing into their circle the very best company. Lady Mary Vivian
      observed that it was a great advantage to her son to have such a house as
      Lord Glistonbury's open to him, to go to whenever he pleased. Besides the
      advantage to his morals, her ladyship was by no means insensible to the
      gratification her pride received from her son's living in such high
      company. The report which had been raised in the country during the
      election, that Mr. Vivian was going to be married to Lady Sarah Lidhurst,
      now began to circulate in town. This was not surprising, since a young man
      in London, of any fortune or notoriety, can hardly dance three or four
      times successively with the same young lady, cannot even sit beside her,
      and converse with her in public half a dozen times, without its being
      reported that he is going to be married to her. Of this, Vivian, during
      his noviciate in town, was not perhaps sufficiently aware: he was soon
      surprised at being asked, by almost every one he met, when his marriage
      with Lady Sarah Lidhurst was to take place. At first he contented himself
      with laughing at these questions, and declaring that there was no truth in
      the report: but his asseverations were not to be believed; they were
      attributed to motives of discretion: he was told by his companions, that
      he kept his own counsel very well; but they all knew <i>the thing was to
      be</i>: he was congratulated upon his good fortune in making such an
      excellent match; for though, as they said, he would have but little money
      with Lady Sarah, yet the connexion was so great, that he was the luckiest
      fellow upon earth. The degree of importance which the report gave him
      among the young men of his acquaintance, and the envy he excited, amused
      and gratified his vanity. The sort of conversation he was now in the
      constant habit of hearing, both from young and old, in all companies,
      about the marriages of people in the fashionable world, where fortune, and
      rank, and <i>connexion</i>, were always the first things spoken of or
      considered, began insensibly to influence Vivian's mode of speaking, if
      not of judging. Before he mixed in this society, he knew perfectly well
      that these were the principles by which <i>people of the world</i> are
      guided; but whilst he had believed this only on hearsay, it had not
      appeared to him so entirely true and so important as when he saw and heard
      it himself. The effect of the opinions of a set of fine people, now he was
      actually in their society, and whilst all other society was excluded from
      his perception, was very different from what he had imagined it might be,
      when he was in the country or at college. To do our hero justice, however,
      he was sensible of this <i>aberration</i> in his own mind, he had sense
      enough to perceive from what causes it arose, and steadiness sufficient to
      adhere to the judgements he had previously and deliberately formed. He did
      not in material points change his opinion of his mistress; he thought her
      far, far superior to all he saw and heard amongst the belles who were most
      admired in the fashionable world; but, at the same time, he began to agree
      with his mother's former wish, that Selina, added to all other merits, had
      the advantage of high birth and connexions, or at least, of belonging to a
      certain class of high company. He determined that, as soon as she should
      be his wife, he would have her introduced to the very <i>first society</i>
      in town: he pleased his imagination with anticipating the change that
      would be made in her appearance, by the addition of certain elegancies of
      the mode: he delighted in thinking of the sensation she would produce, and
      the respect that would be paid to her as Mrs. Vivian, surrounded as he
      would take care that she should be, with all those external signs of
      wealth and fashion, which command immediate and universal homage from the
      great and little world.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when Vivian was absorbed in these pleasing reveries, Russell
      startled him with this question: "When are you to be married to Lady Sarah
      Lidhurst?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From you such a question!" said Vivian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not from me? It is a question that every body asks of me, because I
      am your intimate friend; and I should really be obliged to you, if you
      would furnish me with an answer, that may give me an air of a little more
      consequence than that which I have at present, being forced to answer, 'I
      don't know.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know! but why do not you answer, 'Never!' as I do," said
      Vivian, "to all the fools who ask me the same question?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because they say that is your answer, and only <i>a come off</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't help it&mdash;Is it my fault if they won't believe the truth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, people are apt to trust to appearances in these cases; and if
      appearances are contrary to your assertions, you should not wonder that
      you are not believed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, time will show them their mistake!" said Vivian.&mdash;"But I don't
      know what appearances you mean.&mdash;What appearances are against me?&mdash;I
      never in my life saw a woman I was less disposed to like&mdash;whom it
      would be more impossible for me to love&mdash;than Lady Sarah Lidhurst;
      and I am sure I never gave her, or any of her family, the least reason to
      imagine I had a thought of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely; yet you are at Lord Glistonbury's continually, and you
      attend her ladyship to all public places. Is this the way, do you think,
      to put a stop to the report that has been raised?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I care not whether it stops or goes on," said Vivian.&mdash;"How!&mdash;Don't
      I know it is false?&mdash;That's enough for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may embarrass you yet," said Russell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens!&mdash;Can you, who know me so well, Russell, fancy me so
      weak as to be embarrassed by such a report? Look&mdash;I would rather put
      this hand into that fire and let it be burned off, than offer it to Lady
      Sarah Lidhurst."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely.&mdash;I don't doubt you think so," said Russell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I would do so," said Vivian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly.&mdash;Yet you might be embarrassed nevertheless, if you found
      that you had raised expectations which you could not fulfil; and if you
      found yourself accused of having jilted this lady, if all her friends were
      to say you had used her very ill.&mdash;I know your nature, Vivian; these
      things would disquiet you very much: and is it not better to prevent
      them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But neither Lady Sarah nor her friends blame me: I see no signs in the
      family of any of the thoughts or feelings you suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ladies&mdash;especially young and fashionable ladies&mdash;do not always
      show their thoughts or feelings," said Russell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady Sarah Lidhurst has no thoughts or feelings," said Vivian, "any more
      than an automaton. I'll answer for her&mdash;I am sure I can do her the
      justice to proclaim, that she has always, from the first moment I saw her
      till this instant, conducted herself towards me with the same petrified
      and petrifying propriety."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know what <i>petrified propriety</i> exactly means," said
      Russell: "but let it mean what it may, it is nothing to the present
      purpose; for the question is not about the propriety of Lady Sarah
      Lidhurst's conduct, but of yours. Now, allowing you to call her ladyship a
      petrifaction, or an automaton, or by whatever other name you please,
      still, I apprehend, that she is in reality a human creature, and a woman;
      and I conceive it is the duty of a man of honour or honesty not to deceive
      her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would not deceive her, or any woman living, upon any account," said
      Vivian. "But how is it possible I can deceive her, when I tell you I never
      said a word about love or gallantry, or any thing like it, to her in my
      life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you know language is conventional, especially in gallantry," said
      Russell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True; but I'll swear the language of my looks has been unequivocal, if
      that is what you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not exactly: there are certain signs by which the world JUDGES in these
      cases&mdash;if a gentleman is seen often with the same lady in public."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absurd, troublesome, ridiculous signs, which would put a stop to all
      society; which would prevent a man from conversing with a woman, either in
      public or private; and must absolutely preclude one sex from obtaining any
      real knowledge of the characters and dispositions of the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I admit all you say&mdash;I feel the truth of it&mdash;I wish this were
      changed in society; it is a great inconvenience, a real evil," said
      Russell: "but an individual cannot alter a custom; and, as you have not,
      by your own account, any particular interest in becoming more intimately
      acquainted with the character and disposition of Lady Sarah Lidhurst, you
      will do well not to expose yourself to any inconvenience on her account,
      by neglecting common received forms and opinions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! well!&mdash;say no more about it," said Vivian, impatiently; "spare
      me all farther logic and morality upon this subject, and I'll do what you
      please&mdash;only tell me what you would have me do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gradually withdraw yourself for some time from this house, and the report
      will die away of itself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Withdraw myself!&mdash;that would be very hard upon me!" cried Vivian;
      "for this house is the most agreeable house in town to me;&mdash;because
      you live in it, in the first place; and then, though the women are as
      stiff as pokers, one is always sure of meeting all the pleasant and clever
      men at Glistonbury's good dinner. Let me tell you, good dinners, and good
      company, and good conversation, and good music, make altogether a very
      pleasant house, which I should be confoundedly sorry to be forced to give
      up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't doubt it," said Russell; "but we must often give up more even
      than this for the sake of acting with consistency and honour; we must
      sacrifice the less to the greater good; and it is on these occasions that
      people show strength or weakness of mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian felt the justice of his friend's observations&mdash;resolved to
      follow his advice&mdash;and to withdraw himself gradually from the
      Glistonbury circle. He had not, however, steadiness enough to persist in
      this resolution; one engagement linked on another; and he would soon,
      probably, have relapsed into his habit of being continually of their
      parties, if accident had not for a time suspended this intimacy, by
      leading him into another, which seemed to him still more attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the men of talents and political consequence whom he met at Lord
      Glistonbury's was Mr. Wharton, whose conversation particularly pleased
      Vivian, and who now courted his acquaintance with an eagerness which was
      peculiarly flattering. Vivian knew him only as a man of great abilities;
      with his real character he was not acquainted. Wharton had prepossessing
      manners, and wit sufficient whenever he pleased to make the worse appear
      the better reason. In private or in public debate he had at his command,
      and could condescend to employ, all sorts of arms, and every possible mode
      of annoyance, from the most powerful artillery of logic to the lowest
      squib of humour. He was as little nice in the company he kept as in the
      style of his conversation. Frequently associating with fools, and willing
      even to be thought one, he made alternately his sport and advantage of the
      weakness and follies of mankind. Wharton was philosophically, politically,
      and fashionably profligate. After having ruined his private fortune by
      unbounded extravagance, he lived on&mdash;nobody knew how&mdash;in
      careless profusion. In public life he made a distinguished figure; and
      seemed, therefore, to think himself raised above the necessity of
      practising any of the minor virtues of economy, prudence, or justice,
      which common people find essential to their well-being in society. Far
      from attempting to conceal, he gloried in his faults; for he knew full
      well, that as long as he had the voice of numbers with him, he could
      bully, or laugh, or shame plain reason and rigid principle out of
      countenance. It was his grand art to represent good sense as stupidity,
      and virtue as hypocrisy. Hypocrisy was, in his opinion, the only vice
      which merited the brand of infamy; and from this he took sufficient care
      to prove, or at least to proclaim, himself free. Even whilst he offended
      against the decencies of life, there seemed to be something frank and
      graceful in his manner of throwing aside all disguise. There appeared an
      air of superior liberality in his avowing himself to be governed by that
      absolute selfishness, which other men strive to conceal even from their
      own hearts. He dexterously led his acquaintance to infer that he would
      prove as much better than his professions, as other people are often found
      to be worse than theirs. Where he wished to please, it was scarcely
      possible to escape the fascination of his manner; nor did he neglect any
      mode of courting popularity. He knew that a good table is necessary to
      attract even men of wit; and he made it a point to have the very best
      cook, and the very best wines. He paid his cook, and his cook was the only
      person he did pay, in ready money. His wine-merchant he paid in words&mdash;an
      art in which he was a professed and yet a successful adept, as hundreds of
      living witnesses were ready to attest. But though Wharton could cajole, he
      could not attach his fellow-creatures&mdash;he had a party, but no friend.
      With this distribution of things he was perfectly satisfied; for he
      considered men only as beings who were to be worked to his purposes; and
      he declared that, provided he had power over their interests and their
      humours, he cared not what became of their hearts. It was his policy to
      enlist young men of talents or fortune under his banners; and consequently
      Vivian was an object worthy of his attention. Such was the disorder of
      Wharton's affairs, that either ready money or political power was
      necessary to his existence. Our hero could, at the same time, supply his
      extravagance and increase his consequence. Wharton thought that he could
      borrow money from Vivian, and that he might command his vote in
      parliament; but, to the accomplishment of these schemes, there were two
      obstacles&mdash;Vivian was attached to an amiable woman, and was possessed
      of an estimable friend. Wharton had become acquainted with Russell at Lord
      Glistonbury's; and, in many arguments which they had held on public
      affairs, had discovered that Russell was not a man who ever preferred the
      expedient to the right, nor one who could be bullied or laughed out of his
      principles. He saw also that Russell's influence over Vivian was so great,
      that it supplied him with that strength of mind in which Vivian was
      naturally deficient; and, if our hero should marry such a woman as Miss
      Sidney, Wharton foresaw that he should have no chance of succeeding in his
      designs; therefore his first objects were, to detach Vivian from his
      friend Russell and from Selina. One morning he called upon Vivian with a
      party of his friends, and found him writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poetry!" cried Wharton, carelessly looking at what he had, been writing,
      "poetry, I protest!&mdash;Ay, I know this poor fellow's in love; and every
      man who is in love is a poet, 'with a woeful ditty to his mistress's
      eyebrow.' Pray what colour may Miss Sidney's eyebrows be?&mdash;she is
      really a pretty girl&mdash;I think I remember seeing her at some races.&mdash;Why
      does she never come to town?&mdash;But of course she is not to blame for
      that, but her fortune I suppose.&mdash;Marrying a girl without a fortune
      is a serious thing in these expensive days; but you have fortune enough
      for both yourself and your wife, so you may do as you please. Well, I
      thank God, I have no fortune! If I had been a young man of fortune I
      should have been the most unhappy rascal upon earth, for I should have
      always suspected that every woman liked me for my wealth&mdash;I should
      have had no pleasure in the smiles of an angel&mdash;angels, or their
      mothers, are so venal now-a-days, and so fond of the pomps and vanities of
      this wicked world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope," said Vivian, laughing, "you don't include the whole sex in your
      satire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;there are exceptions&mdash;and every man has his angel of an
      exception, as every woman has her star:&mdash;it is well for weak women
      when these stars of theirs don't lead them astray; and well for weak men
      when these angel exceptions before marriage don't turn out very women or
      devils afterwards. But why do I say all this? because I am a suspicious
      scoundrel&mdash;I know and can't help it. If other fellows of my standing
      in this wicked world would but speak the truth, however, they would show
      as much suspicion and more than I do. Bad as I am, and such as I am, you
      see, and have the whole of me&mdash;nobody can say Wharton's a hypocrite;
      that's some comfort. But, seriously, Vivian, I don't mean to laugh at love
      and angels&mdash;I can just remember the time when I felt all your sort of
      romance&mdash;but that is in the preterpluperfect tense with me&mdash;completely
      past&mdash;ambition is no bad cure for love. My head is, at this present
      moment, so full of this new bill that we are bringing into parliament,
      that Cupid might empty his quiver upon me in vain.&mdash;Look! here is an
      impenetrable shield!" added he, wrapping round him a thick printed copy of
      an act of parliament. "Come, Vivian, you must come along with us to the
      house,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'And, mix'd with men, a man you must appear.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      Vivian felt much ashamed of having been detected in writing a sonnet,
      especially as it afforded Wharton such a fine subject for raillery. He
      accompanied the party to the House of Commons, where Wharton made a
      brilliant speech. It gained universal applause. Vivian sympathized in the
      general enthusiasm of admiration for Wharton's talents, accepted an
      invitation to sup with him, and was charmed by his convivial powers. From
      this day, he grew every hour more intimate with Wharton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can enjoy," thought Vivian, "the pleasure of his society without being
      influenced by his libertine example."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary Vivian saw the rise and progress of this intimacy, and was not
      insensible to its danger; yet she was gratified by seeing her son
      distinguished by a man of Wharton's political consequence; and she
      satisfied her conscience by saying, "He will bring my son forward in
      public life; and, as to the rest, Charles has too good principles ever to
      follow his example in private life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wharton had too much address to alarm Vivian's moral prejudices on a first
      acquaintance. He contented himself with ridiculing only the exaggeration
      of any of the virtues, still affecting to believe in virtue, and to love
      it, wherever it could be found genuine. By the success of his first petty
      attacks, he learned the power that ridicule had over our hero's mind; and
      he did not fail to make use of it continually. After having, as he
      perceived, succeeded in making Vivian ashamed of his sonnet to Selina, and
      of appearing as a romantic lover, he doubted not but in time he should
      make <i>true</i> love itself ridiculous; and Wharton thought it was now
      the moment to hazard another stroke, and to commence his attack against
      friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vivian, my good fellow! why do you let yourself be ruled by that modern
      stoic in the form of Lord Lidhurst's tutor? I never saw any of these cold
      moralists who were real, warm-hearted, good friends. I have a notion I see
      more of Russell's play in the house where he has got than he thinks I do;
      and I can form a shrewd guess why he was so zealous in warning you of the
      report about Lady Sarah Lidhurst&mdash;he had his own snug reasons for
      wanting you away&mdash;Oh, trust me for scenting out self-interest,
      through all the doublings and windings of your cunning moralist!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Reddening with indignation at this attack upon his friend, Vivian warmly
      replied, that Mr. Wharton ought to restrain his wit where the feelings of
      friendship and the character of a man of honour were concerned; that he
      did not, in the least, comprehend his insinuations with regard to Russell;
      but that, for his own part, he had such firm reliance upon his friend's
      attachment and integrity, that he was at any time ready to pledge his own
      honour for Russell's, and to answer for it with his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spare your heroics, my dear Vivian!" cried Wharton, laughing; "for we are
      not in the days of Pylades and Orestes;&mdash;yet, upon my soul, instead
      of being as angry with you as you are with me, at this instant I like you
      a thousand times the better for your enthusiastic credulity. For my part,
      I have, ever since I lived in the world and put away childish things,
      regretted that charming instinct of credulity, which experience so fatally
      counteracts. I envy you, my dear boy!&mdash;as to the rest, you know
      Russell's merits better than I do: I'll take him henceforward upon trust
      from you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thus Wharton, finding that he was upon dangerous ground, made a timely
      retreat: the playful manner and open countenance with which he now spoke,
      and the quick transition that he made to other subjects of conversation,
      prevented Vivian from suspecting that any settled design had been formed
      to detach him from Russell. From this time forward, Wharton forbore
      raillery on love and friendship; and, far from seeming desirous of
      interfering in Vivian's private concerns, appeared quite absorbed in
      politics. Avowing, as he did, that he was guided solely by his interest in
      public life, he laughed at Vivian for professing more generous principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," cried Wharton, "how to make use of a fine word, and to round a
      fine sentence, as well as the best of you; but what a simpleton he must be
      who is cheated by his own sophistry!&mdash;An artist, an enthusiastic
      artist, who is generally half a madman, might fall in love with a statue
      of his own making; but you never heard of a coiner, did you, who was
      cheated by his own bad shilling? Patriotism and loyalty are counterfeit
      coin; I can't be taken in by them at my time of day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian could not forbear to smile at the drollery and wit with which this
      profligate defended his want of integrity; yet he sometimes seriously and
      warmly asserted his own principles. Upon these occasions, Wharton either
      overpowered him by a fine flow of words, or else listened with the most
      flattering air of admiration, and silenced him by compliments to his
      eloquence. Vivian thought that he was quite secure of his own firmness;
      but the contagion of bad example sometimes affects the mind imperceptibly;
      as certain noxious atmospheres steal upon the senses, and excite the most
      agreeable sensations, while they secretly destroy the principles of health
      and life. A day was fixed when a question of importance was to come on in
      the House of Commons. Wharton was extremely anxious to have Vivian's vote.
      Vivian, according to the parliamentary phrase, <i>had not made up his mind</i>
      on the subject. A heap of pamphlets on the question lay uncut upon his
      table. Every morning he resolved to read them, that he might form his
      judgment, and vote according to his unbiassed opinion; but every morning
      he was interrupted by some of the fashionable idlers whom his facility of
      temper had indulged in the habit of haunting him daily. "Oh, Vivian! we
      are going to such and such a place, and you <i>must</i> come with us!" was
      a mode of persuasion which he could not resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I don't do as they do," thought he, "I shall be quite unfashionable.
      Russell may say what he pleases, but it is necessary to yield to one's
      companions in trifles.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'Whoever would be pleased and please,
     Must do what others do with ease.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      This couplet, which had been repeated to him by Wharton, recurred to him
      continually; and thus Wharton, by slight means, in which he seemed to have
      no interest or design, prepared Vivian for his purposes, by working
      gradually on the easiness of his disposition. He always argued, that it
      could not possibly signify what he did with an hour or two of his day,
      till at last Vivian found that he had no hours of his own, that his whole
      time was at the disposal of others; and now that he really wanted leisure
      to consider an important question,&mdash;when his credit, as a member of
      the senate, and as a man just entering political life, depended on this
      decision,&mdash;he literally could not command time to read over the
      necessary documents. So the appointed day arrived before Vivian's opinion
      was formed; and, from mere want of time to decide for himself, he voted as
      Wharton desired. Another and another political question came on; the same
      causes operated, and the same consequences ensued. Wharton managed with
      great address, so as to prevent him from feeling that he gave up his
      freewill. Before Vivian was aware of it, whilst he thought that he was
      perfectly independent of all parties, public opinion had enrolled him
      amongst Wharton's partisans. Of this Russell was the first to give him
      warning. Russell heard of it amongst the political leaders who met at Lord
      Glistonbury's dinners; and, knowing the danger there is of a young man's
      <i>committing</i> himself on certain points, he, with the eagerness of a
      true friend, wrote immediately to put Vivian upon his guard:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Dear Vivian,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am just going into the country with Lord Lidhurst, and perhaps may not
      return for some time. I cannot leave you without putting you on your
      guard, once more, against Mr. Wharton. I understand that you are thought
      to be one of his party, and that he countenances the report. Take care
      that you are not bound hand and foot, before you know where you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your sincere friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      "H. Russell."
    </p>
    <p>
      With the natural frankness of his disposition, Vivian immediately spoke to
      Wharton upon the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! people say that you are one of my party, do they?" said Wharton: "I
      never heard this before, but I am heartily glad to hear it. You are in for
      it now, Vivian: you are one of us; and with us you must stand or fall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me there!" cried Vivian; "I am not of any party; and am determined
      to keep myself independent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you remember the honest Quaker's answer to the man of no party?" said
      Wharton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it was about the year '40, when party disputes about Whig and
      Tory ran high&mdash;but no matter what year, it will do for any time. A
      gentleman of undeviating integrity, an independent man, just such a man as
      Mr. Vivian, offered himself candidate for a town in the east, west, north,
      or south of England&mdash;no matter where, it will do for any place; and
      the first person whose vote he solicited was a Quaker, who asked him
      whether he was a Whig or Tory?&mdash;'Neither. I am an independent,
      moderate man; and when the members of administration are right, I will
      vote with them&mdash;when wrong, against them.' 'And be these really thy
      principles?' quoth the Quaker; 'then a vote of mine thou shalt never have.
      Thou seest my door, it leadeth into the street; the right hand side of
      which is for the Tory, the left for the Whigs; and for a cold-blooded
      moderate man, like thee, there is the kennel, and into it thou wilt be
      jostled, for thou beest not <i>decided</i> enough for any other
      situation.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why should the moderate man be condemned to the kennel?" said Vivian.
      "Was there no middle to your Quaker's road? A stout man cannot be EASILY
      jostled into the kennel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw! pshaw!" said Wharton: "jesting out of the question, a man is
      nothing in public life, or worse than nothing, a <i>trimmer</i>, unless HE
      JOINS a party, and unless he abides by it, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As long as the party is in the right, I presume, you mean," said Vivian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right or wrong'" cried Wharton, "a man must abide by his party. No power,
      and no popularity, trust me, without it!&mdash;Better stride on the greasy
      heads of the mob than be trampled under their dirtier feet. An armed
      neutrality may be a good thing, but an unarmed neutrality is fit only for
      fools. Besides, in Russell's grand style, I can bring down the ancients
      upon you, and tell you that when the commonwealth is in danger he cannot
      be a good man who sides with neither party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it be so necessary to join a party, and if, after once joining it, I
      must abide by it, right or wrong, for life," said Vivian, "it behoves me
      to consider well, before I commit myself; and, before I go into the ranks,
      I must see good reason to confide, not only in the abilities, but in the
      integrity and public virtue of my leader."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Public virtue! sounds fresh from college," said Wharton; "I would as
      soon, and sooner, hear a schoolboy read his theme as hear a man begin to
      prose about public virtue&mdash;especially a member of parliament. Keep
      that phrase, my dear Vivian, till some of the treasury bench come to court
      you; then look superb, like a French tragic actor, swelling out your
      chest, and throwing the head over the left shoulder&mdash;thus&mdash;exclaim,
      'Public virtue forbid!'&mdash;practise! practise!&mdash;for if you do it
      well, it may be worth a loud huzza to you yet; or better still, a snug
      place or pension. But stay till you're asked&mdash;stay till you're asked&mdash;that's
      the etiquette; never till then let me hear public virtue come out of your
      lips, else you'll raise suspicion of your virtue, and lower your price.
      What would you think of a pretty actress who began to talk to you of her
      reputation before you put it in any danger? Oh, Vivian! my honest fellow!
      unless you would make me think you no better than thousands that have gone
      before you, never let me hear from your lips again, till the <i>proper</i>
      time, the hypocritical state phrase&mdash;public virtue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had always, till now, understood that it was possible to be a patriot
      without being a hypocrite," replied Vivian; "I always understood that Mr.
      Wharton was a patriot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very fair sarcasm on me," said Wharton, laughing. "But you know, I'm a
      sad dog; never set myself up for a pattern man.&mdash;Come! let's home to
      dinner, and a truce with politics and morality. I find, Vivian, you're a
      sturdy fellow, and must have your own way; no bending, no leading you, I
      see. Well! it is a good thing to have so much strength of mind: I envy
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be recorded to the credit of our hero, that in defiance of
      Wharton's raillery, he talked, and&mdash;oh! still more wonderful!&mdash;thought
      of public virtue, during nearly half of his first session in parliament.
      But, alas! whilst his political principles thus withstood the force of
      ridicule, temptation soon presented itself to Vivian in a new shape, and
      in a form so seducing, as to draw his attention totally away from
      politics, and to put his private, if not his public, honour, in the most
      imminent peril.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One morning, as Vivian was walking with Mr. Wharton up Bond-street, they
      were met by a party of fashionable loungers, one of whom asked whether
      Mrs. Wharton was not come to town yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Wharton!" said Vivian, with an air of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, she came to town this morning," said Wharton, carelessly; then
      laughing, as he turned to look at Vivian, "Vivian, my good fellow! what
      smites you with such surprise? Did not you know I was married?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose I must have heard it; but I really forgot it," said Vivian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you had the advantage of me," said Wharton, still laughing. "But if
      you never heard of Mrs. Wharton before, keep your own secret; for I can
      tell you she would never forgive you, though I might. Put a good face on
      the matter, at any rate; and swear you've heard so much of her, that you
      were dying to see her. Some of these gentlemen, who have nothing else to
      do, will introduce you whenever you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And cannot I," said Vivian, "have the honour of your introduction?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine! the worst you could possibly have. The honour, as you are pleased
      to call it, would be no favour, I assure you. The honour!&mdash;honour of
      a husband's introduction! What a novice you are, or would make me believe
      you to be! But, seriously, I am engaged to-day at Glistonbury's: so, good
      morning to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Accustomed to hear Wharton talk in the freest manner of women and marriage
      in general, and scarcely having heard him mention his own wife, Vivian
      had, as he said, absolutely forgotten that Wharton was a married man. When
      he was introduced to Mrs. Wharton, he was still more surprised at her
      husband's indifference; for he beheld a lady in all the radiance of
      beauty, and all the elegance of fashion: he was so much dazzled by her
      charms, that he had not immediately power or inclination to examine what
      her understanding or disposition might be; and he could only repeat to
      himself, "How is it possible that Wharton can be indifferent to such a
      beautiful creature!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Incapable of feeling any of what he, called the romance of love, the
      passion, of course, had always been with Mr. Wharton of a very transient
      nature. Tired of his wife's person, he showed his indifference without
      scruple or ceremony. Notorious and glorying in his gallantries, he was
      often heard to declare, that no price was too high to be paid for beauty,
      except a man's liberty; but that was a sacrifice which he would never make
      to any woman, especially to a wife. Marriage vows and custom-house oaths
      he classed in the same order of technical forms,&mdash;nowise binding on
      the conscience of any but fools and dupes. Whilst the husband went on in
      this manner, the wife satisfied herself by indulgence in her strongest
      passions&mdash;the passion for dress and public admiration. Childishly
      eager to set the fashion in trifles, she spent unconscionable sums on her
      pretty person; and devoted all her days, or rather all her nights, to
      public amusements. So insatiable and restless is the passion for
      admiration, that she was never happy for half an hour together, at any
      place of public amusement, unless she fixed the gaze of numbers. The first
      winter after her marriage she enjoyed the prerogatives of a fashionable
      beauty; but the reign of fashion is more transient even than the bloom of
      beauty. Mrs. Wharton's beauty soon grew familiar, and faded in the public
      eye; some newer face was this season the mode. Mrs. Wharton appeared twice
      at the opera in the most elegant and becoming dresses; but no one followed
      her lead. Mortified and utterly dejected, she felt, with the keenest
      anguish, the first symptoms of the decline of public admiration. It was
      just at this period, when she was miserably in want of the consolations of
      flattery, that Vivian's acquaintance with her commenced. Gratified by the
      sort of delighted surprise which she saw in his countenance the first
      moment he beheld her, seeing that he was an agreeable man, and knowing
      that he was a man of fortune and family, she took pains to please him by
      all the common arts of coquetry. But his vanity was proof against these:
      the weakness of the lady's understanding and the frivolity of her
      character were, for some weeks, sufficient antidotes against all the power
      of her personal charms; so much so, that at this period he often compared,
      or rather contrasted, Mrs. Wharton and Selina, and blessed his happy fate.
      He wrote to his friend Russell soon after he was introduced to this
      celebrated beauty, and drew a strong and just parallel between the
      characters of these two ladies: he concluded with saying, "Notwithstanding
      your well-founded dread of the volatility of my character, you will not, I
      hope, my dear Russell, do me the injustice to apprehend that I am in any
      danger from the charms of Mrs. Wharton."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian wrote with perfect sincerity; he believed it to be impossible that
      he could ever become attached to such a woman as Mrs. Wharton, even if she
      had not been married, and the wife of his friend. So, in all the security
      of conscious contempt, he went every day to wait upon her, or rather to
      meet agreeable company at her house,&mdash;a house in which all that was
      fashionable and dissipated assembled; where beauty, and talents, and rank,
      met and mingled; and where political or other arrangements prevented the
      host and hostess from scrupulously excluding some whose characters were
      not free from suspicion. Lady Mary Vivian never went to Mrs. Wharton's;
      but she acknowledged that she knew many ladies of unblemished reputation
      who thought it no impropriety to visit there; and Mrs. Wharton's own
      character she knew was hitherto unimpeached. "She is, indeed, a woman of a
      cold, selfish temper," said Lady Mary; "not likely to be led into danger
      by the tender passion, or by any of the delusions of the imagination."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian agreed with his mother in this opinion, and went on paying his
      devoirs to her every day. It was the fashion of the times, and peculiarly
      the mode of this house, for the gentlemen to pay exclusive attention to
      matrons. Few of the young men seemed to think it worth while to speak to
      an unmarried woman in any company; and the few who might be inclined to it
      were, as they declared, deterred by the danger: for either the young
      ladies themselves, or their mothers, immediately formed expectations and
      schemes of drawing them into matrimony&mdash;the grand object of the
      ladies' wishes and of the gentlemen's fears. The men said they could not
      speak to an unmarried woman, or even dance with her more than twice,
      without its being reported that they were going to be married; and then
      the friends and relatives of the young ladies pretended to think them
      injured and ill-treated, if these reports were not realized. Our hero had
      some slight experience of the truth of these complaints in his own case
      with the Lady Sarah Lidhurst: he willingly took the rest upon trust&mdash;believed
      all the exaggerations of his companions&mdash;and began to think it
      prudent and necessary to follow their example, and to confine his
      attentions to married women. Many irresistible reasons concurred to make
      Mrs. Wharton the most convenient and proper person to whom he could pay
      this sort of homage: besides, she seemed to fall to his share by lot and
      necessity; for, at Wharton's house, every other lady and every other
      gentleman being engaged in gallantry, play, or politics, Mrs. Wharton must
      have been utterly neglected if Vivian had not paid her some attention.
      Common politeness absolutely required it; the attention became a matter of
      course, and was habitually expected. Still he had not the slightest design
      of going beyond the line of modern politeness; but, in certain
      circumstances, people go wrong a great way before they are aware that they
      have gone a single step. It was presently repeated to Mr. Vivian, by some
      of Mrs. Wharton's confidantes, in whispers, and under the solemn promise
      of secrecy, that he certainly was a prodigious favourite of hers. He
      laughed, and affected to disbelieve the insinuation: it made its
      impression, however; and he was secretly flattered by the idea of being a
      prodigious favourite with such a beautiful young creature. In some moments
      he saw her with eyes of compassion, pitying her for the neglect with which
      she was treated by her husband: he began to attribute much of her apparent
      frivolity, and many of her faults, more to the want of a guide and a
      friend than to a deficiency of understanding or to defects of character.
      Mrs. Wharton had just sufficient sense to be cunning&mdash;this implies
      but a very small portion: she perceived the advantage which she gained by
      thus working upon Vivian's vanity and upon his compassion. She continued
      her operations, without being violently interested in their success; for
      she had at first only a general wish to attract his attention, because he
      was a fashionable young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning when he called upon Wharton to accompany him to the House of
      Commons, he found Mrs. Wharton in tears, her husband walking up and down
      the room in evident ill-humour. He stopped speaking when Vivian entered;
      and Mrs. Wharton endeavoured, or seemed to endeavour, to conceal her
      emotion. She began to play on her harp; and Wharton, addressing himself to
      Vivian, talked of the politics of the day. There was some incoherence in
      the conversation; for Vivian's attention was distracted by the air that
      Mrs. Wharton was playing, of which he was passionately fond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no possibility of doing any thing while there is such a cursed
      noise in the room!" cried Wharton. "Here I have the heads of this bill to
      draw up&mdash;I cannot endure to have music wherever I go&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He snatched up his papers and retired to an adjoining apartment, begging
      that Vivian would wait one quarter of an hour for him.&mdash;Mrs.
      Wharton's tears flowed afresh, and she looked beautiful in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see&mdash;you see, Mr. Vivian&mdash;and I am ashamed you should see&mdash;how
      I am treated.&mdash;I am, indeed, the most unfortunate creature upon the
      face of the earth; and nobody in this world has the least compassion for
      me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian's countenance contradicted this last assertion most positively.&mdash;Mrs.
      Wharton understood this; and her attitude of despondency was the most
      graceful imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Mrs. Wharton"&mdash;(it was the first time our hero had ever
      called her "his dear Mrs. Wharton;" but it was only a platonic dear)&mdash;"you
      take trifles much too seriously&mdash;Wharton was hurried by business&mdash;a
      moment's impatience must be forgiven."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A moment!" replied Mrs. Wharton, casting up to heaven her beautiful eyes&mdash;"Oh!
      Mr. Vivian, how little do you know of him!&mdash;I am the most miserable
      creature that ever existed; but there is not a man upon earth to whom I
      would say so except yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian could not help feeling some gratitude for this distinction; and, as
      he leaned over her harp with an air of unusual interest, he said he hoped
      that he should ever prove himself worthy of her esteem and confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant Wharton interrupted the conversation, by passing hastily
      through the room.&mdash;"Come, Vivian," said he; "we shall be very late at
      the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall see you again of course at dinner," said Mrs. Wharton to Vivian
      in a low voice. Our hero replied by an assenting bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes afterwards he repented that he had accepted the invitation,
      because he foresaw that he should resume a conversation which was at once
      interesting and embarrassing. He felt that it was not right to become the
      depository of this lady's complaints against her husband; yet he had been
      moved by her tears, and the idea that he was <i>the only man in the world</i>
      to whom she would open her heart upon such a delicate subject, interested
      him irresistibly in her favour. He returned in the evening, and was
      flattered by observing, that amongst the crowd of company by which she was
      surrounded he was instantly distinguished. He was perfectly persuaded of
      the innocence of her intentions; and, as he was attached to another woman,
      he fancied that he could become the friend of the beautiful Mrs. Wharton
      without danger. The first time he had an opportunity of speaking to her in
      private, he expressed this idea in the manner that he thought the most
      delicately flattering to her self-complacency. Mrs. Wharton seemed to be
      perfectly satisfied with this conduct; and declared, that unless she had
      been certain that he was not a man of gallantry, she should never have
      placed any confidence in his friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I consider you," said she, "quite as a married man:&mdash;by-the-bye,
      when are you to be married, and what sort of a person is Miss Sidney?&mdash;I
      am told she is excessively handsome, and amiable, and sensible.&mdash;What
      a happy creature she is!&mdash;just going to be united to the man she
      loves!" Here the lady gave a profound sigh; and Vivian had an opportunity
      of observing that she had the longest dark eyelashes that he had ever
      seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was married," continued she, "before I knew what I was about. You know
      Mr. Wharton can be so charming when he pleases&mdash;and then he was so
      much in love with me, and swore he would shoot himself if I would not have
      him&mdash;and all that sort of thing.&mdash;I protest I was terrified; and
      I was quite a child, you know. I had been out but six weeks, and I thought
      I was in love with him. That was because I did not know what love was&mdash;<i>then</i>;&mdash;besides,
      he hurried and teased me to such a degree!&mdash;After all, I'm convinced
      I married him more out of compassion than any thing else; and now you see
      how he treats me!&mdash;most barbarously and tyrannically!&mdash;But I
      would not give the least hint of this to any man living but yourself. I
      conjure you to keep my secret&mdash;and&mdash;pity me!&mdash;that is all I
      ask&mdash;pity me sometimes, when your thoughts are not absorbed in a
      happier manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian's generosity was piqued: he could not be so selfish as to be
      engrossed exclusively by his own felicity. He thought that delicacy should
      induce him to forbear expatiating upon Selina's virtues and
      accomplishments, or upon his passion. He carried this delicacy so far,
      that sometimes for a fortnight or three weeks he never mentioned her name.
      He could not but observe that Mrs. Wharton did not like him the less for
      this species of sacrifice. It may be observed, that Mrs. Wharton managed
      her attack upon Vivian with more art than could be expected from so silly
      a woman; but we must consider that all her faculties were concentrated on
      one object; so that she seemed to have an instinct for coquetry. The most
      silly animals in the creation, from the insect tribe upwards, show, on
      some occasions, where their interests are immediately concerned, a degree
      of sagacity and ingenuity, which, compared with their usual imbecility,
      appears absolutely wonderful. The opinion which Vivian had early formed of
      the weakness of this lady's understanding prevented him from being on his
      guard against her artifices: he could not conceive it possible that he
      should be duped by a person so obviously his inferior. With a woman of
      talents and knowledge, he might have been suspicious; but there was
      nothing in Mrs. Wharton to alarm his pride or to awaken his fears: he
      fancied that he could extricate himself in a moment, and with the
      slightest effort, from any snares which she could contrive; and, under
      this persuasion, he neglected to make even that slight effort, and thus
      continued from hour to hour in voluntary captivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insensibly Vivian became more interested for Mrs. Wharton; and, at the
      same time, submitted with increased facility to the influence of her
      husband. It was necessary that he should have some excuse to the world,
      and yet more to his own conscience, for being so constantly at Wharton's.
      The pleasure he took in Wharton's conversation was still a sort of
      involuntary excuse to himself for his intimacy with the lady. "Wharton's
      wit more than Mrs. Wharton's beauty," thought he, "is the attraction that
      draws me here&mdash;I am full as ready to be of his parties as of hers;
      and this is the best proof that all is as it should be."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wharton's parties were not always such as Vivian would have chosen; but he
      was pressed on, without power of resistance. For instance, one night
      Wharton was going with Lord Pontipool and a set of dissipated young men,
      to the house of a lady who made herself fashionable by keeping a
      faro-bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vivian, you'll come along with us?" said Wharton. "Come, we must have you&mdash;unless
      you are more happily engaged."
    </p>
    <p>
      His eye glanced with a mixture of contempt and jealousy upon his wife.
      Mrs. Wharton's alarmed and imploring countenance at the same moment seemed
      to say, "For Heaven's sake, go with him, or I am undone." In such
      circumstances it was impossible for Vivian to say no: he followed
      immediately; acting, as he thought, from a principle of honour and
      generosity. Wharton was not a man to give up the advantage which he had
      gained. Every day he showed more capricious jealousy of his wife, though
      he, at the same time, expressed the most entire confidence in the honour
      of his friend. Vivian still thought he could not do too much to convince
      him that his confidence was not misplaced; and thus, to protect Mrs.
      Wharton from suspicion, he yielded to all her husband's wishes. Vivian now
      felt frequently ashamed of his conduct, but always proud of his motives;
      and, with ingenious sophistry, he justified to himself the worst actions,
      by pleading that he did them with the best intentions.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      By this time Lady Mary Vivian began to hear hints of her son's attachment
      to Mrs. Wharton; and, much alarmed, she repented having encouraged him to
      form a political or fashionable intimacy with the Whartons. Suddenly
      awakened to the perception of the danger, Lady Mary was too vehement in
      her terror. She spoke with so much warmth and indignation, that there was
      little chance of her counsels being of use.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear madam, it is only a platonic attachment," argued Vivian,
      when his mother represented to him that the world talked loudly of his
      intimacy with Mrs. Wharton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A platonic attachment!&mdash;Fashionable, dangerous sophistry!" said Lady
      Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so, ma'am?" said her son, warmly; "and why should we mind what the
      world says? The world is so fond of scandal, that a man and woman cannot
      have any degree of friendship for one another without a hue and cry being
      immediately raised&mdash;and all the prudes and coquettes join at once in
      believing, or pretending to believe, that there must be something wrong.
      No wonder such a pretty woman as Mrs. Wharton cannot escape envy, and, of
      course, censure; but her conduct can defy the utmost malice of her
      enemies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so," said Lady Mary; "and, at all events, I am not one of them. I
      know and care very little about Mrs. Wharton, whom I have always been
      accustomed to consider as a frivolous, silly woman; but what I wish to
      say, though I fear I have lost your confidence, and that my advice will
      not&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frivolous! silly!" interrupted Vivian; "believe me, my dear mother, you
      and half the world are, and have been, under a great mistake about her
      understanding and character."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her forming a platonic friendship with a young man is no great proof of
      her sense or of her virtue," said Lady Mary. "The danger of platonic
      attachments, I thought, had been sufficiently understood. Pray, my dear
      Charles, never let me hear more from you of platonics with married women."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't use the expression, ma'am, if you have any objection to it," said
      Vivian; "but, mother, you wish me to live in the most fashionable company,
      and yet you desire me not to live as they live, and talk as they talk:
      now, that is next to impossible. Pardon me, but I should not have
      thought," added he, laughing, "that you, who like most things that are
      fashionable, would object to <i>platonics</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Object to them!&mdash;I despise, detest, abhor them! <i>Platonics</i>
      have been the ruin of more women, the destruction of the peace of more
      families, than open profligacy ever could have accomplished. Many a
      married woman, who would have started with horror at the idea of beginning
      an intrigue, has been drawn in to admit of a platonic attachment. And many
      a man, who would as soon have thought of committing murder as of seducing
      his friend's wife, has allowed himself to commence a platonic attachment;
      and how these end, all the world knows."
    </p>
    <p>
      Struck by these words, Vivian suddenly quitted his air of raillery, and
      became serious. Had his mother stopped there, and left the rest to his
      good sense and awakened perception of danger, all would have been well;
      but she was ever prone to say too much; and, in her ardour to prove
      herself to be in the right, forgot that people are apt to be shocked, by
      having it pointed out that they are utterly in the wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, the very word platonics," pursued she, "is considered, by those
      who have seen any thing of life, as the mere watchword of knaves or dupes;
      of those who deceive, or of those who wish to be deceived."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be assured, ma'am," said Vivian, "that Mrs. Wharton is not one of those
      who wish either to deceive or to be deceived; and, as to myself, I hope I
      am as far from any danger of being a dupe as of being a knave. My
      connexion with Mrs. Wharton is perfectly innocent; it is justified by the
      example of hundreds and thousands every day in the fashionable world; and
      I should do her and myself great injustice, if I broke off our intimacy
      suddenly, as if I acknowledged that it was improper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what can be more improper? since you force me to speak plainly,"
      cried Lady Mary; "what can be more improper than such an intimacy,
      especially in your circumstances?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My circumstances! What circumstances, ma'am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you forgotten Miss Sidney?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By no means, ma'am," said Vivian, colouring deeply; "Mrs. Wharton is well
      apprized, and was, from the first moment of our friendship, clearly
      informed of my&mdash;&mdash;engagements with Miss Sidney."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how do they agree with your attachment to Mrs. Wharton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly well, ma'am&mdash;Mrs. Wharton understands all that perfectly
      well, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Miss Sidney! do you think she will understand it?&mdash;and is it not
      extraordinary that I should think more of her feelings than you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At these questions Vivian became so angry, that he was incapable of
      listening farther to reason, or to the best advice, even from a mother,
      for whom he had the highest respect. The mother and son parted with
      feelings of mutual dissatisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian, from that spirit of opposition so often seen in weak characters,
      went immediately from his mother's <i>lecture</i> to a party at Mrs.
      Wharton's. Lady Mary, in the mean time, sat down to write to Miss Sidney.
      Whatever reluctance she had originally felt to her son's marriage with
      this young lady, it must be repeated, to her ladyship's credit, that
      Selina's honourable and disinterested conduct had won her entire
      approbation. She wrote, therefore, in the strongest terms to press the
      immediate conclusion of that match, which she now considered as the only
      chance of securing her son's morals and happiness. Her letter concluded
      with these words:&mdash;"I shall expect you in town directly. Do not, my
      dear, let any idle scruples prevent you from coming to my house. Consider
      that my happiness, your own, and my son's, depend upon your compliance. I
      am persuaded, that the moment he sees you, the moment you exert your power
      over him, he will be himself again. But, believe me, I know the young men
      of the present day better than you do: their constancy is not proof
      against absence. If he lose the habit of seeing and conversing with you, I
      cannot answer for the rest.&mdash;Adieu! I am so much harassed by my own
      thoughts, and by the reports I hear, that I scarcely know what I write.
      Pray come immediately, my dear Selina, that I may talk to you of many
      subjects on which I don't like to trust myself to write. My feelings have
      been too long repressed.&mdash;I must unburden my heart to you. <i>You</i>
      only can console and assist me; and, independently of all other
      considerations, you owe to my friendship for you, Selina, not to refuse
      this first request I ever made you.&mdash;Farewell! I shall expect to see
      you as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      "MARY VIVIAN."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>St. James's-street</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      In this letter, Lady Mary Vivian had not explained the nature of her son's
      danger, or of her fears for him. Motives of delicacy had prevented her
      from explicitly telling Miss Sidney her suspicions that Vivian was
      attached to a married woman. "Selina," said her ladyship to herself,
      "must, probably, have heard the report from Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;, who is so
      often at her mother's; therefore, there can be no necessity for my saying
      any more than I have done. She will understand my hints."
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, however, Miss Sidney did not comprehend, or in the least
      suspect, the most material part of the truth; she understood simply, from
      Lady Mary's letter, that Vivian's affections wavered, and she imagined
      that he was, perhaps, on the point of making matrimonial proposals for
      some fashionable belle, probably for one of the Lady Lidhursts; but the
      idea of his becoming attached to a married woman never entered her
      thoughts. Many motives conspired to incline Selina to accept of the
      invitation. The certainty that Lady Mary would be highly offended by a
      refusal; the hint, that her influence over Vivian would operate
      immediately, and in all its force, if he were to see and converse with
      her; and that, on the contrary, absence might extinguish his passion for
      ever; curiosity to learn precisely the nature of the reports, which his
      mother had heard to his disadvantage; but, above all, a fond wish to be
      nearer to the man she loved, and to have daily opportunities of seeing
      him, prompted Selina to comply with Lady Mary's request. On the contrary,
      good sense and delicacy represented, that she had released Vivian from all
      promises, all engagements; that, at parting, she had professed to leave
      him perfectly at liberty: that it would, therefore, be as indelicate as
      imprudent to make such an attempt to reclaim his inconstant heart. She had
      told him, that she desired to have proof of the steadiness, both of his
      character and of his attachment, before she could consent to marry him.
      From this decision she could not, she would not, recede. She had the
      fortitude to persist in this resolution. She wrote to Lady Mary Vivian in
      the kindest, but, at the same time, in the most decided terms, declining
      the tempting invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that Vivian was with his mother at the moment when Selina's
      answer arrived. In the firm belief that such a pressing invitation as she
      had sent, to a person in Selina's circumstances and of Selina's temper,
      could not be refused, her ladyship had made it a point with her son to
      dine <i>tête-à-tête</i> with her this day; and she had been talking to
      him, in the most eloquent but imprudent manner, of the contrast between
      the characters of Mrs. Wharton and Miss Sidney. He protested that his
      esteem and love for Miss Sidney were unabated; yet, when his mother told
      him that he would, perhaps, in a few minutes see his Selina, he changed
      colour, grew embarrassed and melancholy, and thus by his looks effectually
      contradicted his words. He was roused from his reverie by the arrival of
      Selina's letter. His mother's disappointment and anger were expressed in
      the strongest terms, when she found that Selina declined her invitation;
      but such are the quick and seemingly perverse turns of the human heart,
      Vivian grew warm in Selina's defence the moment that his mother became
      angry with her: he read her letter with tender emotion, for he saw through
      the whole of it, the strength, as well as the delicacy of her attachment.
      All that his mother's praises had failed to effect, was immediately
      accomplished by this letter; and he, who but an instant before dreaded to
      meet Selina, now that she refused to come, was seized with a strong desire
      to see her; his impatience was so great, that he would willingly have set
      out that instant for the country. Men of such characters as Vivian's are
      peculiarly jealous of their free will; and, precisely because they know
      that they are easily led, they resist, in affairs of the heart especially,
      the slightest appearance of control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary was delighted to hear her son declare his resolution to leave
      town the next morning, and to see Miss Sidney as soon as possible; but she
      could not forbear reproaching him for not doing what she wanted precisely
      in the manner in which she had planned that it should be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see, my dear Charles," cried she, "that even when you do right, I must
      not flatter myself that it is owing to any influence of mine. Give my
      compliments to Miss Sidney, and assure her that I shall in future forbear
      to injure her in your opinion by my interference, or even by expressing my
      approbation of her character. My anger, it is obvious, has served her
      better than my kindness; and therefore she has no reason to regret that my
      affection has been lessened, as I confess it has been, by her late
      conduct."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, when Vivian was prepared to leave town, he called upon
      Wharton, to settle with him about some political, business which was to be
      transacted in his absence. Wharton was not at home&mdash;Vivian knew that
      it would be best to avoid seeing Mrs. Wharton; but he was afraid that she
      would be offended, and he could not help <i>sacrificing a few minutes to
      politeness</i>. The lady was alone; apparently very languid, and
      charmingly melancholy. Before Vivian could explain himself, she poured
      forth, in silly phrases, but in a voice that made even nonsense please, a
      rariety of reproaches for his having absented himself for such a length of
      time.&mdash;"Positively, she would keep him prisoner, now that she had him
      safe once more." To be kept prisoner by a fair lady was so flattering,
      that it was full an hour before he could prevail upon himself to assert
      his liberty&mdash;the fear of giving pain, indeed, influenced him still
      more than vanity. At last, when Mrs. Wharton spoke of her engagements for
      the evening, and seemed to take it for granted that he would be of her
      party, he summoned resolution sufficient&mdash;Oh! wonderful effort of
      courage!&mdash;to tell her, that he was under a necessity of leaving town
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going, I presume, to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the country," said Vivian, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the country!&mdash;&mdash;No, no, no; say at once, to Selina!&mdash;Tell
      me the worst in one word!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Astonished beyond measure, Vivian had not power to move. The lady fell
      back on the sofa in violent hysterics. Our hero trembled lest any of her
      servants should come in, or lest her husband should at his return find her
      in this condition, and discover the cause. He endeavoured in vain to
      soothe and compose the weeping fair one; he could not have the barbarity
      to leave her in this state. By sweet degrees she recovered her
      recollection&mdash;was in the most lovely confusion&mdash;asked where she
      was, and what was going to happen. Vivian had not the rashness to run the
      risk of a second fit of hysterics; he gave up all thoughts of his journey
      for this day, and the lady recovered her spirits in the most flattering
      manner. Vivian intended to postpone his journey only for a single day;
      but, after he had yielded one point, he found that there was no receding.
      He was now persuaded that Mrs. Wharton was miserable; that she would never
      forgive herself for having betrayed the state of her heart. His self-love
      pleaded powerfully in her favour: he considered that her husband treated
      her with mortifying neglect, and provoked the spirit of retaliation by his
      gallantries. Vivian fancied that Mrs. Wharton's attachment to him might
      render her wretched, but would never make her criminal. With sophistical
      delicacy he veiled his own motives; and, instead of following the plain
      dictates of reason, he involved his understanding in that species of
      sentimental casuistry which confounds all principles of right and wrong.
      But the dread that he felt lest Wharton should discover what was going on
      might have sufficiently convinced him that he was not acting honourably.
      The suspicions which Mr. Wharton formerly showed of his wife seemed now to
      be completely lulled asleep; and he gave Vivian continually such proofs of
      confidence as stung him to the soul. By an absurd, but not an uncommon
      error of self-love, Vivian was induced to believe, that a man who
      professed to cheat mankind in general behaved towards him in particular
      with strict honour, and even with unparalleled generosity. Honesty was too
      vulgar a virtue for Wharton; but honour, the aristocratic, exclusive
      virtue of a gentleman, he laid claim to in the highest tone. The very
      frankness with which Wharton avowed his libertine principles with respect
      to women, convinced Vivian that he had not the slightest suspicion that
      these could be immediately applied to the ruin of his own wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can you, my dear Wharton, talk in this manner?" said Vivian once,
      when he had been speaking with great <i>freedom</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it is better," added he, with a sigh, "to speak than to act like a
      villain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Villain!" repeated Wharton, with a sarcastic laugh; "you are grown quite
      ridiculous, Vivian: I protest, I don't understand you. Women now-a-days
      are surely able, if not willing enough, to take care of themselves; and <i>villains</i>,
      though they were very common in the time of Miss Clarissa Harlowe, and of
      all the tragedy queens of the last century, are not to be heard of in
      these days. Any strange tales of those male monsters called seducers could
      gain credit during the ages of ignorance and credulity; but now, the
      enlightened world cannot be imposed upon by such miracles; and a gentleman
      may be a man of gallantry&mdash;nay, even a lady may be a woman of
      gallantry&mdash;without being hooted out of society as a <i>monster</i>;
      at all events, the blame is, as it should be, equally divided between the
      parties concerned; and if modern lovers quarrel, they do not die of grief,
      but settle their differences in a court of law, where a spinster may have
      her compensation for a breach of contract of marriage; a father or a
      husband their damages for the loss of the company, affection, solace,
      services, &amp;c., as the case may be, of his wife or daughter. All this
      is perfectly well understood; and the terrors of law are quite sufficient,
      without the terrors of sentiment. If a man punish himself, or let himself
      be punished, twice for the same offence, once by his conscience, and once
      by his king and his country, he is a fool; and, moreover, acts contrary to
      the spirit of the British law, which sayeth&mdash;see Blackstone and
      others&mdash;that no man shall be punished twice for the same offence.&mdash;Suffer
      your risible muscles to relax, I beseech you, Vivian; and do not affect a
      presbyterian rigidity, which becomes your face as ill as your age."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I affect nothing&mdash;certainly I do not affect presbyterian rigidity,"
      cried Vivian, laughing. "But, after all, Wharton, if you had a daughter or
      a sister, what would you think of any man, your friend for instance, who
      should attempt&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To cut your speech short at once," interrupted Wharton, "I should not
      think at all about the matter; I should blow his brains out, of course;
      and afterwards, probably, blow out my own. But treachery from a friend&mdash;from
      a man of honour&mdash;is a thing of which I can hardly form an idea. Where
      I give my confidence, I give it without any paltry mental reservation&mdash;I
      could not suspect a friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian suffered, at this instant, all the agony which a generous mind,
      conscious of guilt, could endure. He thought that the confusion of his
      mind must be visible in his countenance&mdash;his embarrassment was so
      great that he could not utter a word. Wharton did not seem to perceive his
      companion's agitation, but passed on carelessly to other subjects of
      conversation; and at length completely relieved Vivian from fear of
      immediate detection, by asking a favour from him&mdash;a pecuniary favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All is safe&mdash;Mrs. Wharton, at least, is safe, thank Heaven!" thought
      Vivian. "Had her husband the slightest suspicion, he never would
      condescend to accept of any favour from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      With eagerness, and almost with tears of gratitude, Vivian pressed upon
      Wharton the money which he <i>condescended</i> to borrow&mdash;it was no
      inconsiderable sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wharton!" cried he, "you sometimes talk freely&mdash;too freely; but you
      are, I am convinced, the most open-hearted, unsuspicious, generous fellow
      upon earth&mdash;you deserve a better friend than I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      Unable any longer to suppress or conceal the emotions which struggled in
      his heart, he broke away abruptly, hurried home, shut himself up in his
      own apartment, and sat down immediately to write to Mrs. Wharton. The idea
      that Mrs. Wharton loved him in preference to all the fashionable coxcombs
      and wits by whom she was surrounded had insensibly raised our hero's
      opinion of her understanding so much, that he now imagined that the world
      laboured under a prejudice against her abilities. He gave himself credit
      for having discovered that this beauty was not a fool; and he now spoke
      and wrote to her as if she had been a woman of sense. With eloquence which
      might have moved a woman of genius, with delicacy that might have touched
      a woman of feeling, he conjured her to fortify his honourable resolutions;
      and thus, whilst it was yet time, to secure her happiness and his own.
      "Instead of writing this letter," added he in a postscript, "I ought,
      perhaps, to fly from you for ever; but that would show a want of
      confidence in you and in myself; and, besides, upon the most mature
      reflection, I think it best to stay, and wait upon you to-morrow as usual,
      lest, by my precipitation, I should excite suspicion in Wharton's mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      The weak apprehension that Mrs. Wharton should betray herself by another
      fit of hysterics, if he should leave town, and if his departure should be
      suddenly announced to her by her husband, or by some common acquaintance,
      induced him to delay a few days longer, that he might prepare her mind by
      degrees, and convince her of the necessity for their absolute separation.
      When he had finished his letter to Mrs. Wharton, he was sufficiently well
      pleased with himself to venture to write to Miss Sidney. His letters to
      her had of late been short and constrained; but this was written with the
      full flow of affection. He was now in hopes that he should extricate
      himself honourably from his difficulties, and that he might at last claim
      his reward from Selina.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After he had despatched his two letters, he became excessively anxious to
      receive Mrs. Wharton's answer. By trifling but unavoidable accidents, it
      was delayed a few hours. At last it arrived; Vivian tore it open, and read
      with surprise these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your letter is just what I wished, and makes me the happiest of women&mdash;that
      is, if you are sincere&mdash;which, after all you've said, I can't doubt.
      I am so hurried by visitors, and annoyed, that I cannot write more; but
      shall have time to talk to-night at the opera."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the opera Mrs. Wharton appeared in high spirits, and was dressed with
      more than usual elegance. It was observed that she had never been seen to
      look so beautiful. There was something in her manner that puzzled Vivian
      extremely; this extraordinary gaiety was not what he had reason to expect.
      "Is it possible," thought he, "that this woman is a mere coquette, who has
      been amusing herself at my expense all this time, and can now break off
      all connexion with me without a moment's regret?" Vivian's pride was
      piqued: though he wished to part from the lady, he could not bear that
      this parting should evidently cost her nothing. He was mortified beyond
      expression by the idea that he had been duped. After the opera was over,
      whilst Mrs. Wharton was waiting for her carriage, he had an opportunity of
      speaking to her without being overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am happy," said he, with a constrained voice, "I am extremely happy to
      see you, madam, in such charming spirits to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But are not you a strange man to look so grave?" cried Mrs. Wharton. "I
      vow, I don't know what to make of you! But I believe you want to quarrel
      for the pleasure of making it up again. Now that won't do. By-the-bye, I
      have a quarrel with you, sir.&mdash;How came you to sign your name to that
      foolish stuff you wrote me yesterday? Never do so any more, I charge you,
      for fear of accidents. But what's the matter now?&mdash;You are a strange
      mortal!&mdash;Are you going to die upon the spot?&mdash;What is the
      matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My letter to you was not signed, I believe," said Vivian, in an altered
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed it was," said Mrs. Wharton. "It was signed Charles Vivian at full
      length. But why are you in such tremors about it? I only mentioned it to
      put you on your guard in future.&mdash;I've burnt the letter&mdash;people
      always get themselves into scrapes if they don't burn love-letters&mdash;as
      I've often heard Mr. Wharton say," added she, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his unspeakable consternation, Vivian now discovered that he had sent
      the letter intended for Selina to Mrs. Wharton; and that which was
      designed for Mrs. Wharton he had directed to Miss Sidney. Vivian was so
      lost in thought, that the cry of <i>"Mrs. Wharton's carriage stops the
      way!"</i> was vociferated many times before he recovered sufficient
      presence of mind to hand the lady out of the house. He went home
      immediately, that he might reflect upon what was best to be done. His
      servant presently gave him a letter which a messenger had just brought
      from the country. The packet was from Selina.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enclosed, I return the letter which I received from you this morning. I
      read the first three lines of it before I perceived that it could not be
      intended for me&mdash;I went no farther.&mdash;I cannot help knowing for
      whom it was designed; but you may be assured that your secret shall be
      kept inviolably.&mdash;You have no reproaches to fear from me.&mdash;This
      is the last letter I shall ever write to you.&mdash;Leave it to me to
      explain my own conduct to my mother and to yours; if they think me
      capricious, I can bear it. I shall tell them that my sentiments are
      totally changed: I am sure I can say so with perfect truth.&mdash;Oh,
      Vivian, it is you who are to be pitied; every thing may be endured except
      remorse. Would to Heaven, I could save you from the reproaches of your own
      heart!&mdash;Adieu!
    </p>
    <p>
      "SELINA SIDNEY."
    </p>
    <p>
      The feelings of Vivian's mind, on reading this letter, cannot be
      described. Admiration, love, tenderness, remorse, successively seized upon
      his heart. Incapable of any distinct reflection, he threw himself upon his
      bed, and closed his eyes, endeavouring to compose himself to sleep, that
      he might forget his existence. But, motionless as he lay, the tumult of
      his mind continued unabated. His pulse beat high; and before morning he
      was in a fever. The dread that his mother should come to attend him, and
      to inquire into the cause of his illness, increased his agitation:&mdash;she
      came. Her kindness and anxiety were fresh torments to her unhappy son.
      Bitterly did he reproach himself as the cause of misery to those he loved
      and esteemed most in the world. He became delirious; and, whilst he was in
      this state, he repeated Mrs. Wharton's name sometimes in terms of
      endearment, sometimes in accents of execration. His mother's suspicions of
      his intrigue were confirmed by many expressions which burst from him, and
      which were thought by his attendants to be merely the ravings of fever.
      Lady Mary had, at this crisis, the prudence to conceal her doubts, and to
      keep every body, as much as possible, out of her son's apartment. In a few
      days his fever subsided, and he recovered to the clear recollection of all
      that had passed previously to his illness. He almost wished to be again
      delirious. The first time he was left alone, he rose from his bed,
      unlocked his bureau, and seized Selina's letter, which he read again and
      again, studying each line and word, as if he could draw from them every
      time a new meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She read but three lines of my letter," said he to himself; "then she
      only guesses that I have an intrigue with Mrs. Wharton, without knowing
      that in this very letter I used my utmost influence to recall Mrs. Wharton
      to&mdash;herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      The belief that Selina thought worse of him than he deserved was some
      consolation to Vivian. He was resolved to recover her esteem: he
      determined to break off all connexion with Mrs. Wharton; and, full of this
      intention, he was impatient till the physicians permitted him to go
      abroad. When he was at last free from their dominion, had escaped from his
      chamber, and had just gained the staircase, he was stopped by his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charles," said she, "before you quit me again, it is my duty to say a few
      words to you upon a subject of some importance."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary led the way to her dressing-room with a dignified air; Vivian
      followed with a mixture of pride and alarm in his manner. From the bare
      idea of a maternal lecture his mind revolted: he imagined that she was
      going to repeat the remonstrance which she had formerly made against his
      intimacy with Mrs. Wharton, and against <i>platonics</i> in general; but
      he had not the least apprehension that she had discovered the whole truth:
      he was, therefore, both surprised and shocked, when she spoke to him in
      the following manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The libertinism of the age in which we live has so far loosened all the
      bonds of society, and all the ties of nature, that I doubt not but a
      mother's anxiety for the morals of her son&mdash;her only son&mdash;the
      son over whose education she has watched from his infancy, may appear,
      even in his eyes, a fit subject for ridicule. I am well aware that my
      solicitude and my counsels have long been irksome to him, I have lost his
      affections by a steady adherence to my duty; but I shall persevere with
      the less reluctance, since the dread of my displeasure, or the hope of my
      approbation, cannot now touch his sensibility. During your illness, you
      have betrayed a secret&mdash;you have reason to start with horror. Is it
      possible that a son of mine, with the principles which I have endeavoured
      to instil into his mind, should become so far depraved? Do I live to hear,
      from his own lips, that he is the seducer of a married woman&mdash;and
      that woman the wife of his friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian walked up and down the room in great agony: his mother continued,
      with increased severity of manner, "I say nothing of your dissimulation
      with me, nor of all your <i>platonic</i> subterfuges&mdash;I know that,
      with a man of intrigue, falsehood is deemed a virtue. I shall not
      condescend to inquire farther into your guilty secrets&mdash;I now think
      myself fortunate in having no place in your confidence. But I here declare
      to you, in the most solemn manner, that I never will see you again until
      all connexion between you and Mrs. Wharton is utterly dissolved. I do not
      advise&mdash;I COMMAND, and must be obeyed&mdash;or I cast you off for
      ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary left the room as she uttered these words. Her son was deeply
      struck with his mother's eloquence: he knew she was right, yet his pride
      was wounded by the peremptory severity of her manner:&mdash;his remorse
      and his good resolutions gave place to anger. The more he felt himself in
      the wrong, the less he could bear to be reproached by the voice of
      authority. Even because his mother <i>commanded</i> him to give up all
      connexion with Mrs. Wharton, he was inclined to disobey&mdash;he could not
      bear to seem to do right merely in compliance to her will. He went to
      visit Mrs. Wharton in a very different temper from that in which, half an
      hour before this conference with his mother, he had resolved to see the
      lady. Mrs. Wharton knew how to take advantage both of the weakness of his
      character and of the generosity of his temper. She fell into transports of
      grief when she found that Lady Mary Vivian and Miss Sidney were in
      possession of her secret. It was in vain that Vivian assured her that it
      would be kept inviolably; she persisted in repeating, "that her reputation
      was lost; that she had sacrificed every thing for a man who would, at
      last, desert her in the most treacherous and barbarous manner, leaving her
      at the mercy of her husband, the most profligate, hard-hearted tyrant upon
      earth. As to her being reconciled to him," she declared, "<i>that</i> was
      totally out of the question; his behaviour to her was such, that she could
      not live with him, even if her heart were not fatally prepossessed in
      favour of another." Her passions seemed wrought to the highest pitch. With
      all the eloquence of beauty in distress, she appealed to Vivian as her
      only friend; she threw herself entirely upon his protection; she vowed
      that she could not, would not, remain another day in the same house with
      Mr. Wharton; that her destiny, her existence, were at Vivian's mercy.
      Vivian had not sufficient fortitude to support this scene. He stood
      irresolute. The present temptation prevailed over his better resolutions.
      He was actually persuaded by this woman, whom he did not love, whom he
      could not esteem, to carry her off to the continent&mdash;whilst, at the
      very time, he admired, esteemed, and loved another. The plan of the
      elopement was formed and settled in a few minutes;&mdash;on Mrs. Wharton's
      part, apparently with all the hurry of passion; on Vivian's with all the
      confusion of despair. The same carriage, the very same horses, that had
      been ordered to carry our hero to his beloved Selina, conveyed him and
      Mrs. Wharton the first stage of their flight towards the continent. The
      next morning the following paragraph appeared in the newspapers:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yesterday, the beautiful and fashionable Mrs. W&mdash;&mdash;, whose
      marriage we announced last year to the celebrated Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;,
      eloped from his house in St. James's-street, in company with C&mdash;&mdash;
      V&mdash;&mdash;, member for &mdash;&mdash;shire. This catastrophe has
      caused the greatest <i>sensation</i> and astonishment in the circles of
      fashion; for the lady in question had always, till this fatal step,
      preserved the most unblemished reputation; and Mr. and Mrs. W&mdash;&mdash;
      were considered as models of conjugal felicity. The injured husband was
      attending his public duty in the House of Commons; and, as we are credibly
      informed, was, with patriotic ardour, speaking in his country's cause,
      when this unfortunate event, which for ever bereaves him of domestic
      happiness, took place. What must increase the poignancy of his feelings
      upon the occasion remains to be stated&mdash;that the seducer was his
      intimate friend, a young man, whom he had raised into notice in public
      life, and whom he had, with all that warmth and confidence of heart for
      which he is remarkable, introduced into his house, and trusted with his
      beloved wife. Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; is, we hear, in pursuit of the
      fugitives."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the modern fashionable code of honour, when a man has seduced or
      carried off his friend's wife, the next thing he has to do is to fight the
      man whom he has injured and betrayed. By thus appealing to the ordeal of
      the duel, he may not only clear himself from guilt; but, if it be done
      with proper spirit, he may acquire celebrity and glory in the annals of
      gallantry, and in the eyes of the fair and innocent. In our hero's place,
      most men of fashion would have triumphed in the notoriety of his offence,
      and would have rejoiced in an opportunity of offering the husband the
      satisfaction of a gentleman. But, unfortunately for Vivian, he had not yet
      suited his principles to his practice: he had acted like a man of fashion;
      but, alas! he still thought and felt like a man of virtue&mdash;as the
      following letter will show.
    </p>
    <p>
      "TO THE REV. HENRY RUSSELL.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indignant as you will be, Russell, at all you hear of me, you cannot be
      more shocked than I am myself. I do not write to palliate or apologize&mdash;my
      conduct admits of no defence&mdash;I shall attempt none, private or public&mdash;I
      have written to my lawyer to give directions that no sort of defence shall
      be set up on my part, when the affair comes into Doctors' Commons&mdash;as
      it shortly will; for I understand that poor Wharton has commenced a
      prosecution. As to damages he has only to name them&mdash;any thing within
      the compass of my fortune he may command. Would to God that money could
      make him amends! But he is too generous, too noble a fellow&mdash;profligate
      as he is in some things, how incapable would he be of acting as basely as
      I have done! There is not, perhaps, at this moment, a human being who has
      so high an opinion of the man I have injured as I have myself:&mdash;he
      did not love his wife&mdash;but that is no excuse for me&mdash;his honour
      is as much wounded as if I had robbed him of her during the time he loved
      her most fondly:&mdash;he once doted upon her, and would have loved her
      again, when he was tired of his gallantries; and they might then have
      lived together as happily as ever, if I had not been&mdash;. What was I?&mdash;What
      am I?&mdash;Not a villain&mdash;or I should glory in what I have done&mdash;but
      the weakest of human beings&mdash;and how true it is, Russell, that 'all
      wickedness is weakness!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand that W&mdash;&mdash;, wherever he goes, calls me a coward,
      as well as a scoundrel; and says that I have kept out of the way to avoid
      fighting him. He is mistaken. It is true, I had the utmost dread of having
      his life to answer for&mdash;and nothing should have provoked me to fire
      upon him;&mdash;but I had determined how to act&mdash;I would have met
      him, and have stood his fire. I should not be sorry, at present, to be put
      out of the world; and would rather fall by his hand than by any other. But
      since this is out of the question, and that things have taken another
      turn, I have only to live, as long as it shall please God, a life of
      remorse&mdash;and, at least, to try to make the unfortunate woman who has
      thrown herself upon my protection as happy as I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you have any remaining regard for a pupil who has so disgraced you, do
      me one favour&mdash;Go to Miss Sidney, and give her what comfort you can.
      Say nothing <i>for me</i>, or <i>of me</i>, but that I wish her to forget
      me as soon as possible. She discarded me from her heart when she first
      discovered this intrigue&mdash;before this last fatal step. Still I had
      hopes of recovering her esteem and affection; for I had resolved&mdash;But
      no matter what I resolved&mdash;all my resolutions failed; and now I am
      utterly unworthy of her love. This, and all that is good and happy in
      life, all the fair hopes and virtuous promises of my youth, I must give
      up. Early as it is in my day, my sun has set. I truly desire that she
      should forget me; for you know I am bound in honour&mdash;Honour! How dare
      I use the word? I am bound, after the divorce, to marry the woman I have
      seduced. Oh, Russell! what a wife for your friend!&mdash;What a
      daughter-in-law for my poor mother, after all her care of my education&mdash;all
      her affection&mdash;all her pride in me!&mdash;It will break her heart!
      Mine will not break. I shall drag on, perhaps, to a miserable old age. I
      am of too feeble a nature to feel these things as strong minds would&mdash;as
      you will for me; but do not blame yourself for my faults. All that man
      could do for me, you did. This must be some consolation to you, my dear
      and excellent friend! May I still call you friend?&mdash;or have I no
      friend left upon earth?
    </p>
    <p>
      "C. VIVIAN."
    </p>
    <p>
      From this letter some idea may be formed of what this unhappy man suffered
      at this period of his life, from "the reflections of a mind not used to
      its own reproaches." The view of the future was as dreadful as the
      retrospect of the past. His thoughts continually dwelt upon the public
      trial which was preparing&mdash;before him he saw all its disgraceful
      circumstances. Then the horror of marrying, of passing his whole future
      existence with a woman whom he could not esteem or trust! These last were
      secret subjects of anxiety and anguish, the more intensely felt, because
      he could not speak of them to any human being. Such as Mrs. Wharton was,
      she was to be his wife; and he was called upon to defend her against
      reproach and insult,&mdash;if possible, from contempt. During the course
      of six weeks, which they spent together in exile at Brussels, Vivian
      became so altered in his appearance, that his most intimate friends could
      scarcely have known him; his worst enemies, if he had had any, could not
      have desired the prolongation of his sufferings.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, as he was sitting alone in his hotel, ruminating bitter
      thoughts, a letter was brought to him from Mr. Russell; the first he had
      received since he left England. Every one, who has been absent from his
      friends in a foreign country, must know the sort of emotion which the bare
      sight of a letter from <i>home</i> excites; but, in Vivian's
      circumstances, abandoned as he felt himself, and deserving to be abandoned
      by his best friends, the sight of a letter from Russell so struck him,
      that he gazed upon the direction for some minutes, almost without power or
      wish to open it. At last he opened, and read, "Return to your country,
      your friends, and yourself, Vivian! Your day is not yet over! Your sun is
      not yet set!&mdash;Resume your energy&mdash;recover your self-confidence&mdash;carry
      your good resolutions into effect&mdash;and you may yet be an honour to
      your family, a delight to your fond mother, and the pride of your friend
      Russell. Your remorse has been poignant and sincere; let it be salutary
      and permanent in its consequences: this is the repentance which religion
      requires. The part of a man of sense and virtue is to make his past errors
      of use to his future conduct. Whilst I had nothing to say that could give
      you pleasure, I forbore to answer your letter; I forbore to overwhelm a
      mind sinking under remorse. My sacred duty is to waken the sinner to
      repentance, not to shut the gates of mercy on the penitent. Now, I can
      relieve your mind from part of the load by which it has been justly
      oppressed. You know that nothing can palliate your conduct in an intrigue
      with a married woman&mdash;from this I had hoped your moral and religious
      education would have preserved you. But of the premeditated guilt of
      deceiving the husband, and laying a plan to seduce the wife, I never
      suspected you; and I may now tell you, that you have not betrayed Mr.
      Wharton; he has betrayed you. You have not seduced Mrs. Wharton; you have
      been seduced by her. You are not bound to marry her&mdash;Wharton cannot
      obtain a divorce&mdash;he dare not bring the affair to trial; if he does,
      he is undone. There has been collusion between the parties. The proof of
      this you will find in the enclosed paper, which will be sworn to, in due
      legal form, whenever it is necessary. Even when you see them, you will
      scarcely believe these 'damning proofs' of Wharton's baseness. But I
      always knew, I always told you, that this pretence to honour and candour,
      frankness and friendship, with this avowed contempt of all principle and
      all virtue, could not be safe, could not be sincere, would not <i>stand
      the test</i>.&mdash;No&mdash;nothing should make me trust to the private
      honour of a man so corrupt in public life as Mr. Wharton. A man who sells
      his conscience for his interest will sell it for his pleasure. A man who
      will betray his country will betray his friend. It is in vain to palter
      with our conscience: there are not two honours&mdash;two honesties. How I
      rejoice at this moment, in the reflection that your character, as a public
      man, is yet untarnished You have still this great advantage:&mdash;feel
      its value. Return, and distinguish yourself among your countrymen:
      distinguish yourself by integrity still more than by talents. A certain
      degree of talents is now cheap in England: integrity is what we want&mdash;true
      patriotism, true public spirit, noble ambition not that vile scramble for
      places and pensions, which some men call ambition; not that bawling,
      brawling, <i>Thersites</i> character, which other men call public spirit;
      not that marketable commodity with which Wharton, and such as he, cheat
      popular opinion for a season;&mdash;but that fair virtue which will
      endure, and abide by its cause to the last; which, in place or out, shall
      be the same; which, successful or unsuccessful, shall sustain the
      possessor's character through all changes of party; which, whilst he
      lives, shall command respect from even the most profligate of his
      contemporaries; upon which, when he is dying, he may reflect with
      satisfaction; which, after his death, shall be the consolation of his
      friends, and the glory of his country. All this is yet in your power,
      Vivian.&mdash;Come, then, and fulfil the promise of your early years!
      Come, and restore to your mother a son worthy of her!&mdash;Come, and
      surpass the hopes of your true friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      "H. RUSSELL."
    </p>
    <p>
      The rapid succession of feelings with which Vivian read this letter can
      scarcely be imagined. The paper it enclosed was from a former waiting-maid
      of Mrs. Wharton's; a woman who was expected to be the principal evidence
      on Mr. Wharton's side. She had been his mistress; one of those innumerable
      mistresses, to whom he had, of course, addressed his transferable promises
      of eternal constancy. She too, of course, had believed the vow, in spite
      of all experience and probability; and while she pardoned his infidelities
      to her mistress, &amp;c. all which she deemed <i>very natural for a
      gentleman like him</i>, yet she was astonished and outrageous when she
      found him faithless to her own charms. In a fit of jealousy she flew to
      Mr. Russell, whom she knew to be Vivian's friend; and, to revenge herself
      on Wharton, revealed the secrets which she had in her power; put into
      Russell's hands the proofs of collusion between Mr. Wharton and his wife;
      and took malicious pains to substantiate her evidence, to a lawyer's full
      satisfaction; knowing that she might prevent the possibility of a divorce,
      and that she should thus punish her perjured inconstant in the most
      sensible manner, by at once depriving him of twenty thousand pounds
      damages, and by chaining him again to a wife whom he abhorred.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same post which brought Vivian this woman's deposition and Russell's
      letter brought Mrs. Wharton notice that the whole plan of collusion was
      discovered: she was therefore prepared for Vivian's reproaches, and
      received the first burst of his astonishment and indignation with a
      studied Magdalen expression of countenance: then she attempted a silly
      apology, laying all the blame on her husband, and vowing that she had
      acted under terror, and that her life would not have been safe in his
      hands if she had not implicitly obeyed and executed his horrid plans. She
      wept and kneeled in vain. Finding Vivian immoveable in his purpose to
      return immediately to England, she suddenly rose from her knees, and, all
      beautiful as she was, looked in Vivian's eyes like a fiend, whilst, with
      an unnatural smile, she said to him, "You see, fool as I am thought to be,
      I have been too clever for <i>some people</i>; and I can tell Mr. Wharton
      that I have been too clever for him too. His heart is set upon a divorce;
      but he can't have it. He can't marry Miss P&mdash;&mdash;, nor yet her
      fortune, nor ever shall! I shall remain at Brussels&mdash;I have friends
      here&mdash;and friends who were my friends before I was forced to give my
      hand to Mr. Wharton, or my smiles to you, sir!&mdash;people who will not
      tease me with talking of remorse and repentance, and such ungallant,
      ungentlemanlike stuff; nor sit bewailing themselves, like a country
      parson, instead of dashing out with me here in a fashionable style, as a
      man of any spirit would have done. But you!&mdash;you're neither good nor
      bad; and no woman will ever love you, nor ever did. Now you know my whole
      mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would to Heaven I had known it sooner!" said Vivian. "No&mdash;I rejoice
      that I did not sooner know, and that I never could have suspected, such
      depravity!&mdash;under such a form, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wharton's eye glanced with satisfaction upon the large mirror
      opposite to her. Vivian left her in utter disgust and horror. "Drive on!"
      cried he, as he threw himself into the chaise that was to carry him away;
      "Faster! faster!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The words, "and no woman will ever love you, nor ever, did," rung upon
      Vivian's ear. "There she is mistaken, thank Heaven!" said he to himself:
      yet the words still dwelt upon his mind, and gave him exquisite pain. Upon
      looking again at Russell's letter, he observed that Selina Sidney's name
      was never mentioned; that she was neither directly nor indirectly alluded
      to in the whole letter. What omen to draw from this he could not divine.
      Again he read it; and all that Russell said of public life, and his
      exhortations to him to come and distinguish himself in public and in the
      political world, struck him in a new light. It seemed as if Russell was
      sensible that, there were no farther hopes of Selina, and that therefore
      he tried to turn Vivian's mind from love to ambition. Fourteen times he
      read over this letter before he reached England; but he could not discover
      from it any thing as to the point on which his heart was most interested.
      He reached London in this, uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put me out of suspense, my best friend," cried he, the moment he saw
      Russell: "tell me, is Selina living?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;she has been very ill, but is now recovered&mdash;quite
      recovered, and with your mother, who is grown fonder of her than ever she
      was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Selina alive! well! and with my mother!&mdash;and may I&mdash;I don't
      mean may I <i>now</i>,&mdash;but may I <i>ever</i> hope?&mdash;Believe me,
      I feel myself capable of any exertions, any forbearance, to obtain her
      forgiveness&mdash;to merit&mdash;May I ever hope for it?&mdash;Speak!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Russell assured him that he need not dread Miss Sidney's resentment, for
      that she felt none; she had expressed pity more than anger&mdash;that she
      had taken pains to sooth his mother; and had expressed sincere
      satisfaction on hearing of his <i>release</i> from his unworthy bondage,
      and at his return home to his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone in which Russell spoke, and the seriousness and embarrassment of
      his manner, alarmed Vivian inexpressibly. He stood silent, and dared not
      ask farther explanation for some minutes.&mdash;At length he broke
      silence, and conjured his friend to go immediately to Miss Sidney and his
      mother, and to request permission for him to see them both in each other's
      presence. Russell said, that if Vivian insisted, he would comply with his
      request; but that he advised him not to attempt to see Miss Sidney at
      present; not till he had been some time in London&mdash;till he had given
      some earnest of the steadiness of his conduct&mdash;till he had appeared
      again, and distinguished himself in public life. "This might raise you
      again in her esteem; and," continued Russell, "you must be aware that her
      love depends on her esteem&mdash;at least, that the one cannot exist
      without the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you deliver a letter to her from me?" said Vivian. "If you think I
      had better not attempt to see her yet, you will deliver a letter for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      After some hesitation, or rather some deliberation, Russell answered, in a
      constrained voice, "I will deliver your letter, if you insist upon it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian wrote:&mdash;Russell undertook to deliver the letter, though with
      evident reluctance. In the mean time Vivian went to see his mother, whom
      he longed, yet dreaded to meet. Her manner was not now severe and haughty,
      as when she last addressed him; but mild and benign: she held out her hand
      to him, and said, "Thank God! my son is restored to me, and to himself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She could say no more; but embraced him tenderly. Russell had shown Lady
      Mary that her son had been the dupe of a preconcerted scheme to work upon
      his passions. She deplored his weakness, but she had been touched by his
      sufferings; and was persuaded that his remorse would guard him against
      future errors. Therefore not a word or look of reproach escaped from her.
      When he spoke of Selina, Lady Mary, with great animation of countenance
      and warmth of eulogium, declared, that it was the first wish of her heart
      to see her son married to a woman of such a noble character and angelic
      temper; "<i>but</i>," added her ladyship, her manner changing suddenly, as
      she pronounced the word <i>but</i>&mdash;before she could explain the <i>but</i>,
      Russell came into the room, and told Vivian that Miss Sidney desired to
      see him. Vivian heard the words with joy; but his joy was checked by the
      great gravity and embarrassment of his friend's countenance, and by a sigh
      of ill omen from his mother. Eager to relieve his suspense, he hastened to
      Selina, who, as Russell told him, was in Lady Mary's dressing-room&mdash;the
      room in which he had first declared his passion for her. Hope and fear
      alternately seized him&mdash;fear prevailed the moment that he beheld
      Selina. Not that any strong displeasure appeared in her countenance&mdash;no,
      it was mild and placid; but it was changed towards him, and its very
      serenity was alarming. Whilst she welcomed him to his native country and
      to his friends, and while she expressed hopes for his future happiness,
      all hope forsook him, and, in broken sentences, he attempted to stammer
      out some answer; then, throwing himself into a chair, he exclaimed, "I see
      all future happiness is lost for me&mdash;and I deserve it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not reproach yourself," said Selina in a sweet voice; but the voice,
      though sweet, was so altered to him, that it threw him into despair. "It
      is my wish, not to inflict, but to spare you pain. I have, therefore,
      desired to see you as soon as possible, that you might not form false
      expectations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you no longer love me, Selina? Now, after all I have suffered, you
      have the cruelty to tell me so? And you, who could form my character to
      every thing that is good and honourable; you, who alone could restore me
      to myself&mdash;you reject, you cast me from you for ever?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have suffered much," said Selina, in a trembling voice, "since we
      parted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian's eye quickly ran over her face and whole form as she spoke these
      words; and he saw, indeed, traces of sickness and suffering: with the idea
      of his power over her affections, his hopes revived; he seized the feeble
      hand, which lay motionless; but she withdrew it decidedly, and his hopes
      again forsook him, when she gently raised her head, and continued to
      speak, "I have suffered much since we parted, Mr. Vivian; and I hope you
      will spare me unnecessary and useless pain in this interview: painful to a
      certain degree it must be to both of us; for I cannot, even now that all
      feelings of passion have subsided, and that the possibility of my being
      united to you is past, tell you so, with all the composure which I had
      expected to do; nor with all the firmness of voice and manner which is
      necessary, perhaps, to convince you of the truth, and to restore your mind
      to itself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The possibility of my being united to you is past!&mdash;Why?"
      interrupted Vivian, incapable of understanding or listening to any thing
      else, till this question was answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not force me to what may seem like cruel reproach; but let it suffice
      for me to say, that my sentiments have been so much altered by a <i>year's
      experience</i>, that it is impossible for me ever to become your wife. My
      love was founded on esteem. I had, indeed, always fears of the instability
      of your character; therefore, I put your resolution to the proof: the
      event has proved to me that my fears were but too just. I speak with
      difficulty; for I cannot easily give you so much pain as I know that I am
      inflicting at this moment. But," resumed she, in a more resolute tone, "it
      is absolutely necessary for your future peace of mind, as well as for my
      own, that I should convince you I am sincere, perfectly sincere, at this
      moment; that I know my own heart; that my determination has not been
      hastily formed, and cannot be altered. The deliberate manner in which I
      now speak to you will, I hope, persuade you of this truth. And if I have
      hesitated, or showed any agitation in this interview, attribute it to its
      real cause&mdash;the weakness of my health; feebleness of body, not of
      mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose to leave the room; but Vivian detained her, beseeching her, with
      all the eloquence of passion in despair, to hear him but for one moment;
      whilst he urged that there was no probability of his ever relapsing into
      errors from which he had suffered so much; that now his character was
      formed by adversity; and that such was the power which Selina possessed
      over his heart, that a union with her would, at this crisis, decide his
      fate; that her steadiness would give stability to his resolutions; and
      that his gratitude would so increase his affection, that he should have
      the strongest possible motives to make her a good husband; that when he
      was happy in domestic life, he should feel every energy of his mind
      revive; that he should exert all his powers to distinguish himself, and to
      justify the choice of the woman he adored.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the word <i>adored</i>, which has usually such power to
      confound female judgment, Selina perceived that all he said was merely a
      repetition of his former arguments, of which experience had proved the
      insufficiency. She was aware that, if before marriage his resolution and
      constancy had not been able to support the trial, it would be folly or
      madness to marry him with the vague hope that she might reform his
      character. She therefore continued steady to her resolution; and as she
      found that Vivian's disappointment was greater than she had expected, she
      immediately withdrew from his mother's house. The next morning, when
      Vivian came to breakfast, after having spent a sleepless night, planning
      new arguments or new intreaties in favour of his love, he found that Miss
      Sidney was gone. His mother and his friend Russell joined in representing
      to him that it would be useless to follow her, that it would only give
      himself and Selina unavailing pain. Vivian felt this stroke severely. His
      mind was, as it were, adrift again. After the first violence of his
      feelings had spent itself, and when he sunk into that kind of apathy which
      is the consequence of exhausted passion, his friend Russell endeavoured to
      excite him to honourable ambition. Vivian caught the idea, that if he
      distinguished himself in public life, and if he there displayed any
      steadiness of character, he might win back Selina's esteem and affection.
      Fired with this hope, he immediately turned his whole mind to the object;
      applied with indefatigable ardour, day and night, to make himself master
      of the subjects likely to be discussed in the ensuing session of
      parliament. At length his application and his energy were crowned with
      success. On a question of considerable political importance, which he had
      carefully considered, he made an excellent speech; a speech which directly
      made him of consequence in the house; which, in the language of the
      newspapers, "was received with unbounded applause, was distinguished for
      strength of argument, lucid order, and a happy choice of expression." But
      what encouraged our hero more than newspaper puffs or party panegyrics was
      the approbation of his friend Russell. Russell never praised violently;
      but a few words, or even a look of satisfaction from him, went farther
      than the most exaggerated eulogiums from others. Vivian pursued his course
      for some time with honour and increasing reputation. There was one man who
      never joined in any of the compliments paid to the rising orator; there
      was one man who always spoke of him with contempt, who pronounced that
      "Vivian would never go far in politics&mdash;that it was not in him&mdash;that
      he was too soft&mdash;<i>que c'étoit bâtir sur de la boue, que de compter
      sur lui</i>." This depreciator and enemy of Vivian was the man who, but a
      few months before, had been his political <i>proneur</i> and unblushing
      flatterer, Mr. Wharton. Exasperated by the consciousness of his own
      detected baseness, and provoked still more by his being frustrated in all
      his schemes, Wharton now practised every art that a malicious and
      unprincipled wit could devise to lower the opinion of Vivian's talents,
      and to prevent his obtaining either power or celebrity. Our hero was
      stimulated by this conduct to fresh exertions. So far Wharton's enmity was
      of service to him; but it was of disservice, by changing, in some measure,
      the purity of the motives from which he acted. With love and honourable
      ambition now mixed hatred, thoughts of vengeance, views of vulgar vanity
      and interest: he thought more of contradicting Mr. Wharton's prophecies
      than of fulfilling his own ideas of what was fair and right. He was
      anxious to prove, that he could "<i>go far</i> in politics, that it was <i>in
      him</i>, that he was not too soft, and that it was not building on mud to
      depend on him." These indefinite expressions operated powerfully and
      perniciously on his imagination. To prove that Wharton was mistaken in his
      prognostics, it was necessary to our hero to obtain the price and stamp of
      talents&mdash;it was essential to gain political power; and this could not
      be attained without joining a party. Vivian joined the party then in
      opposition. Wharton and he, though both in opposition, of course, after
      what had passed, could never meet in any private company; nor had they any
      communication in public, though on the same side of the question: their
      enmity was so great, that not only the business of the nation, but even
      the interests of their party, were often impeded by their quarrels. In the
      midst of these disputes, Vivian insensibly adopted more and more of the
      language and principles of the public men with whom he daily associated.
      He began to hear and talk of compensations and jobs, as they did; and to
      consider all measures proved to be necessary for the support of his party
      as expedient, if not absolutely right. His country could not be saved,
      unless he and his friends could obtain the management of affairs; and no
      men, be found, could gain parliamentary influence, or raise themselves
      into political power, without <i>acting as a body</i>. Then, of course,
      all subordinate points of right were to be sacrificed to the great good of
      promoting the views of the party. Still, however, his patriotism was upon
      the whole pure; he had no personal views of interest, no desire even to be
      in place, independently of a wish to promote the good of his country.
      Secret overtures were, about this time, made to him by government; and
      inquiries were made if there was any thing which could gratify him, or by
      which he could be induced to lay aside his opposition, and to assist in
      supporting their measures. Many compliments to his talents and eloquence,
      and all the usual <i>commonplaces</i>, about the expediency and propriety
      of <i>strengthening the hands of government</i>, were, of course, added.
      Something <i>specific</i> was at length mentioned: it was intimated, that
      as he was of an ancient family, it might gratify him that his mother
      should be made a baroness in her own right. The offer was declined, and
      the temptation was firmly withstood by our hero; his credit was now at its
      <i>acme</i> with his own coadjutors. Lady Mary whispered the circumstance,
      as a state secret, to all her acquaintance; and Russell took care that
      Miss Sidney should hear of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian was now cited as an incorruptible patriot. Wharton's malice, and
      even his wit, was almost silenced; yet he was heard to say, amidst the din
      of applause, "This is only the first offer; he is in the right to make a
      show of resistance: he will coquet for a time, and keep <i>philandering</i>
      on till he suits himself, and then he'll jilt us, you'll see."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such speeches, though they reached Vivian's ear by the kind officiousness
      of friends, were never made by Mr. Wharton so directly that he could take
      hold of them; and Russell strenuously advised him not to seek occasion to
      quarrel with a man who evidently desired only to raise his own reputation
      by making Vivian angry, getting him in the wrong, and forcing him into an
      imprudent duel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let your actions continue to contradict his words, and they can never
      injure you," said Russell.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time Vivian adhered to his friend's advice, and he proudly felt
      the superiority of principle and character. But, alas! there was one
      defence that his patriotism wanted&mdash;economy. Whilst he was thus
      active in the public cause, and exulting in his disinterestedness, his
      private affairs were getting into terrible disorder. The expense of
      building his castle had increased beyond all his calculations&mdash;the
      expense of his election&mdash;the money he had lost at play whilst he was
      in Wharton's society&mdash;the sums he had lent to Wharton&mdash;the money
      he had spent abroad,&mdash;all these accumulated brought him to great
      difficulties: for though his estate was considerable, yet it was so
      settled and tied up that he could neither sell nor mortgage. His creditors
      became clamorous&mdash;he had no means of satisfying or quieting them: an
      execution was actually sent down to his castle, just as it was finished.
      Lady Mary Vivian was in the greatest alarm and distress: she had no means
      of extricating her son. As to his fashionable friends&mdash;no hopes from
      such extravagant and selfish beings. What was to be done? At this critical
      moment, the offers from <i>a certain quarter</i> were renewed in another,
      and, as it seemed, a more acceptable form,&mdash;a pension was proffered
      instead of a title; and it was promised that the business should be so
      managed, and the pension so held in another name, that nothing of the
      transaction should transpire; and that his seceding from opposition should
      be made to appear a change of sentiments from conviction, not from
      interested motives. Vivian's honourable feelings revolted from these
      offers, and abhorred these subterfuges; but distress&mdash;pecuniary
      distress! he had never before felt its pressure; he had never till now
      felt how powerful, how compulsatory it is over even generous and
      high-spirited souls. Whilst Vivian was thus oppressed with difficulties,
      which his imprudence had brought upon him; whilst his mind was struggling
      with opposing motives, he was, most fortunately for his political
      integrity, relieved, partly by accident, and partly by friendship. It
      happened that the incumbent of the rich living, of which Vivian had the
      presentation, was dying just at this time; and Russell, instead of
      claiming the living which Vivian had promised to him, relinquished all
      pretensions to it, and insisted upon his friend's disposing of his right
      of presentation. The sum which this enabled Vivian to raise was fully
      sufficient to satisfy the execution which had been laid on his castle; and
      the less clamorous creditors were content to be paid by instalments,
      annually, from his income. Thus he was saved for the present; and he
      formed the most prudent resolves for the future. He was most sincerely
      grateful to his disinterested friend. The full extent of the sacrifice
      which Russell made him was not, however, known at this time, nor for some
      years afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, without anticipation, let us proceed with our story. Amongst those
      fashionable and political friends with whom our hero had, since his return
      to England, renewed his connexion, was my Lord Glistonbury. His lordship,
      far from thinking the worse of him for <i>his affair</i> with Mrs.
      Wharton, spoke of it in modish <i>slang</i>, as "a new and fine feather in
      his cap;" and he congratulated Vivian upon his having "carried off the
      prize without paying the price." Vivian's success as a parliamentary
      orator had still further endeared him to his lordship, who failed not to
      repeat, that he had always prophesied Vivian would make a capital figure
      in public life; that Vivian was his member, &amp;c. At the recess, Lord
      Glistonbury insisted upon carrying Vivian down to spend the holidays with
      him at Glistonbury Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must come, Vivian: so make your fellow put your worldly goods into my
      barouche, which is at the door; and we are to have a great party at
      Glistonbury, and private theatricals, and the devil knows what; and you
      must see my little Julia act, and I must introduce you to <i>the Rosamunda</i>.
      Come, come! you can't refuse me!&mdash;Why, you have only a bachelor's
      castle of your own to go to; and that's a dismal sort of business,
      compared with what I have <i>in petto</i> for you&mdash;'the feast of
      reason, and the flow of soul,' in the first style, I assure you. You must
      know, I always&mdash;even in the midst of the wildest of my wild oats&mdash;had
      a taste for the belles-lettres, and philosophy, and the muses, and the <i>literati,</i>
      and so forth&mdash;always a touch of the Mecaenas about me.&mdash;And now
      my boy's growing up, it's more particularly proper to bring these sort of
      people about him; for, you know, clever men who have a reputation can
      sound a flourish of trumpets advantageously before 'a Grecian youth of
      talents rare' makes his appearance on the stage of the great world&mdash;Ha!
      hey!&mdash;Is not this what one may call prudence?&mdash;Ha!&mdash;Good to
      have a father who knows something of life, and of books too, hey? Then,
      for my daughters, too&mdash;daughter, I mean; for Lady Sarah's Lady
      Glistonbury's child: her ladyship and Miss Strictland have manufactured
      her after their own taste and fashion; and I've nothing to say to that&mdash;But
      my little Julia&mdash;Ah, I've got a different sort of governess about her
      these few months past&mdash;not without family battles, you may guess. But
      when Jupiter gives the nod, you know, even Juno, stately as she is, must
      bend. So I have my Rosamunda for my little Julia&mdash;who, by-the-bye, is
      no longer my <i>little</i> Julia, but a prodigious fine woman, as you
      shall see. But, all this time, is your fellow putting your things up? No!&mdash;Hey?
      how? Oh, I understand your long face of hesitation&mdash;you have not seen
      the ladies since the Wharton affair, and you don't know how they might
      look.&mdash;Never fear! Lady Glistonbury shall do as I please, and look as
      I please. Besides, <i>entre nous</i>, I know she hates the Whartons; so
      that her morality will have a loophole to creep out of; and you'll be safe
      and snug, whilst all the blame will be thrown on them&mdash;Hey!&mdash;Oh,
      I understand things&mdash;pique myself on investigating the human heart.
      Come, we have not a moment to lose; and you'll have your friend Russell,
      too&mdash;Come, come! to have and to hold, as the lawyers say&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Seizing Vivian's arm, Lord Glistonbury carried him off before he had half
      understood all his lordship had poured forth so rapidly; and before he had
      decided whether he wished or not to accept of this invitation.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On his way to Glistonbury Castle, Vivian had full leisure to repent of
      having accepted of this invitation, recollecting, as he did, all the
      former reports about himself and Lady Sarah Lidhurst. He determined,
      therefore, that his visit should be as short as possible; and the chief
      pleasure he promised himself was the society of his friend Russell.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his arrival at the castle, he was told that Mr. Russell was out riding;
      and that every body else was in the theatre at a rehearsal, except Lady
      Glistonbury, the Lady Sarah, and Miss Strictland. He found these three
      ladies sitting in form in the great deserted drawing-room, each looking
      like a copy of the other, and all as if they were deploring the degeneracy
      of the times. Vivian approached with due awe; but, to his great surprise
      and relief, at his approach their countenances exhibited some signs of
      life. Lord Glistonbury <i>presented</i> him on his return from abroad:
      Lady Glistonbury's features relaxed to a smile, though she seemed
      immediately to repent of it, and to feel it incumbent upon her to maintain
      her rigidity of mien. Whilst she, and of course Miss Strictland and the
      Lady Sarah, were thus embarrassed between the necessity of reprobating the
      sin, and the desire of pleasing the sinner, Lord Glistonbury ran on with
      one of his speeches, of borrowed sense and original nonsense, and then
      would have carried him off to the rehearsal, but Lady Glistonbury called
      Vivian back, begging, in her formal manner, "that her lord would do her
      the favour to leave Mr. Vivian with her for a few minutes, as it was so
      long since she had the pleasure of seeing him at Glistonbury." Vivian
      returned with as good a grace as he could; and, to find means of breaking
      the embarrassing silence that ensued, took up a book which lay upon the
      table, "Toplady's Sermons"&mdash;no hope of assistance from that: he had
      recourse to another&mdash;equally unlucky, "Wesley's Diary:" another&mdash;"The
      Pilgrim's Progress." He went no farther; but, looking up, he perceived
      that the Lady Sarah was <i>motioned</i> by her august mother to leave the
      room. Vivian had again recourse to "Toplady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very unfashionable books, Mr. Vivian," said Miss Strictland, bridling and
      smiling as in scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very unfashionable books!" repeated Lady Glistonbury, with the same
      inflection of voice, and the same bridling and smiling. "Very different,"
      continued her ladyship, "very different from what you have been accustomed
      to see on <i>some</i> ladies' tables, no doubt, Mr. Vivian! Without
      mentioning names, or alluding to transactions that ought to be buried in
      eternal oblivion, and that are so very distressing to your friends here to
      think of, sir, give me leave to ask, Mr. Vivian, whether it be true what I
      have heard, that the prosecution, and every thing relative to it, is
      entirely given up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Entirely, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said Lady Glistonbury, glancing her eye at Miss Strictland, "<i>we</i>
      may welcome Mr. Vivian with safe consciences to Glistonbury; and since the
      affair will never become public, and since Lady Sarah knows none of the
      improper particulars; and since she may, and, from her education,
      naturally will, class all such things under the head of impossibilities
      and false reports, of which people, in our rank of life especially, are
      subject every hour to hear so many; there cannot, as I am persuaded you
      will agree with me in thinking, Miss Strictland, be any impropriety in our
      and Lady Sarah's receiving Mr. Vivian again on the same footing as
      formerly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Strictland bowed her formal assent: Vivian bowed, because he saw that
      a bow was expected from him; and then he pondered on what might be meant
      by the words, <i>on the same footing as formerly</i>; and he had just
      framed a clause explanatory and restrictive of the same, when he was
      interrupted by the sound of laughter, and of numerous, loud, and mingled
      voices, coming along the gallery that led to the drawing-room. As if these
      were signals for her departure, and as if she dreaded the intrusion and
      contamination of the revel rout, Lady Glistonbury arose, looked at her
      watch, pronounced her belief that it was full time for her to go to dress,
      and retired through a Venetian door, followed by Miss Strictland,
      repeating the same belief, and bearing her ladyship's tapestry work: her
      steps quickened as the door at the opposite end of the room opened; and,
      curtsying (an unnecessary apology to Mr. Vivian) as she passed, she left
      him <i>to himself</i>. And now,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "He sees a train profusely gay,
     Come pranckling o'er the place."
</pre>
    <p>
      Some were dressed for comic, some for tragic characters; but all seemed
      equally gay, and talked equally fast. There had been a dressed rehearsal
      of "The Fair Penitent," and of "The Romp;" and all the spectators and all
      the actors were giving and receiving exuberant compliments. Vivian knew
      many of the party,&mdash;some of them bel-esprits, some fashionable
      amateurs; all pretenders to notoriety, either as judges or performers. In
      the midst of this motley group, there was one figure who stood receiving
      and expecting universal homage: she was dressed as "The Fair Penitent;"
      but her affected vivacity of gesture and countenance was in striking
      contrast to her tragic attire; and Vivian could hardly forbear smiling at
      the <i>minauderies</i> with which she listened and talked to the gentlemen
      round her; now languishing, now coquetting; rolling her eyes, and throwing
      herself into a succession of studied attitudes, dealing repartees to this
      side and to that; and, in short, making the greatest possible exhibition
      both of her person and her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you know her? Did you never see her before?&mdash;No! you've been
      out of England; but you've heard of her, certainly?&mdash;<i>Rosamunda</i>,"&mdash;whispered
      Lord Glistonbury to Vivian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who is Rosamunda?" said Vivian; "an actress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Actress!&mdash;Hush!&mdash;Bless you! no&mdash;but the famous poetess. Is
      it possible that you hav'n't read the poems of Rosamunda?&mdash;They were
      in every body's hands a few months ago; but you were abroad&mdash;better
      engaged, or as well, hey? But, as I was going to tell you, that's the
      reason she's called <i>The Rosamunda</i>&mdash;I gave her the name, for I
      patronized her from the first. Her real name is Bateman; and Lady
      Glistonbury and her set call her Miss Bateman still, but nobody else.
      She's an amazing clever woman, I assure you&mdash;more genius than any of
      'em since the time of Rousseau!&mdash;Devil of a salary!&mdash;and devil
      of a battle I had to fight with some of my friends before I could fix her
      here; but I was determined I would follow my own ideas in Julia's
      education. Lady Glistonbury had her way and her routine with Lady Sarah;
      and it's all very well, vastly well&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'Virtue for her too painful an endeavour,
     Content to dwell in decencies for ever.'
</pre>
    <p>
      You know the sort of thing! Yes, yes; but I was not content to have my
      Julia lost among the <i>mediocres</i>, as I call them: so I took her out
      of Miss Strictland's hands; and the Rosamunda's her governess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her governess!" repeated Vivian, with uncontrollable astonishment; "Lady
      Julia Lidhurst's governess!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you may well be surprised," pursued Lord Glistonbury, mistaking the
      cause of the surprise: "no one in England could have done it but myself;
      she refused innumerable applications,&mdash;immense offers; and, after
      all, you know, she does not appear as governess <i>titrée</i>&mdash;only
      as a friend of the family, who directs Lady Julia Lidhurst's literary
      talents. Oh, you understand, a man of the world knows how to manage these
      things&mdash;sacrifices always to the vanity of the sex, or the pride, as
      the case may be, I never mind names, but things, as the metaphysicians say&mdash;distinguish
      betwixt essentials and accidents&mdash;sound philosophy that, hey? And,
      thank Heaven! a gentleman or a nobleman need not apologize in these days
      for talking of philosophy before ladies, even if any body overheard us,
      which, as it happens, I believe nobody does. So let me, now that <i>you
      know your Paris</i>, introduce you to 'The Rosamunda.'&mdash;Mr. Vivian&mdash;the
      Rosamunda. Rosamunda&mdash;Mr. Vivian."
    </p>
    <p>
      After Vivian had for a few minutes acted audience, very little to his own
      satisfaction, he was relieved by Lord Glistonbury's exclaiming, "But
      Julia! where's Julia all this time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamunda looked round, with the air of one interrupted by a frivolous
      question which requires no answer; but some one less exalted, and more
      attentive to the common forms of civility, told his lordship that Lady
      Julia was in the gallery with her brother. Lord Glistonbury hurried Vivian
      into the gallery. He was struck the moment he met Lady Julia with the
      great change and improvement in her appearance. Instead of the childish
      girl he had formerly seen flying about, full only of the frolic of the
      present moment, he now saw a fine graceful woman with a striking
      countenance that indicated both genius and sensibility. She was talking to
      her brother with so much eagerness, that she did not see Vivian come into
      the gallery; and, as he walked on towards the farther end, where she was
      standing, he had time to admire her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fine girl, faith! though she is my daughter," whispered Lord
      Glistonbury; "and would you believe that she is only sixteen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only sixteen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay: and stay till you talk to her&mdash;stay till you hear her&mdash;you
      will be more surprised. Such genius! such eloquence! She's my own girl.
      Well, Julia, my darling!" cried he, raising his voice, "in the clouds, as
      usual?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Julia started&mdash;but it was a natural, not a theatric start&mdash;colouring
      at the consciousness of her own absence of mind. She came forward with a
      manner that apologized better than words could do, and she received Mr.
      Vivian so courteously, and with such ingenuous pleasure in her
      countenance, that he began to rejoice in having accepted the invitation to
      Glistonbury; at the same instant, he recollected a look which his mother
      had given him when he first saw Lady Julia on the terrace of the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what was she saying to you, Lidhurst? hey! my boy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We were arguing, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arguing! Ay, ay, she's the devil for that!&mdash;words at will!&mdash;'Persuasive
      words, and more persuasive sighs!' Ah, woman! woman for ever! always
      talking us out of our senses! and which of the best of us would not wish
      it to be so? 'Oh! let me, let me be deceived!' is the cream of philosophy,
      epicurean and stoic&mdash;at least, that's my creed. But to the point:
      what was it about that she was holding forth so charmingly&mdash;a book or
      a lover? A book, I'll wager: she's such a romantic little fool, and so
      unlike other women: leaves all her admirers there in the drawing-room, and
      stays out here, talking over musty books with her brother. But come, what
      was the point? I will have it argued again before me&mdash;Let's see the
      book."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lidhurst pointed out a speech in "The Fair Penitent," and said that
      they had been debating about the manner in which it should be recited.
      Lord Glistonbury called upon his daughter to repeat it: she showed a
      slight degree of unaffected timidity at first; but when her father stamped
      and bid her let him see no vulgar bashfulness, she obeyed&mdash;recited
      charmingly&mdash;and, when urged by a little opposition from her brother,
      grew warm in defence of her own opinion&mdash;displayed in its support
      such sensibility, with such a flow of eloquence, accompanied with such
      animated and graceful, yet natural gesture, that Vivian was transported
      with sudden admiration. He was astonished at this early development of
      feeling and intellect; and if, in the midst of his delight, he felt some
      latent disapprobation of this display of talent from so young a woman, yet
      he quickly justified her to himself, by saying that he was not a stranger;
      that he had formerly been received by her family on a footing of intimacy.
      Then he observed farther, in her vindication, that there was not the
      slightest affectation or coquetry in any of her words or motions; that she
      spoke with this eagerness not to gain admiration, but because she was
      carried away by her enthusiasm, and, thoughtless of herself, was eager
      only to persuade and to make her opinions prevail. Such was the
      enchantment of her eloquence and her beauty, that after a quarter of an
      hour spent in her company, our hero did not know whether to wish that she
      had more sedateness and reserve, or to rejoice that she was so animated
      and natural. Before he could decide this point, his friend Russell
      returned from riding. After the first greetings were over, Russell drew
      him aside, and asked, "Pray, my dear Vivian, what brings you here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord Glistonbury&mdash;to whom I had not time to say no, he talked so
      fast. But, after all, why should I say no? I am a free man&mdash;a
      discarded lover. I am absolutely convinced that Selina Sidney's refusal
      will never be retracted; my mother, I know, is of that opinion. You
      suggested, that if I distinguished myself in public life, and showed
      steadiness, I might recover her esteem and affection; but I see no chance
      of it. My mother showed me her last letter&mdash;no hopes from that&mdash;so
      I think it would be madness, or folly, to waste my time, and wear out my
      feelings, in pursuit of a woman, who, however amiable, is lost to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of that you are the best judge," said Russell, gravely. "I am far from
      wishing&mdash;from urging you to waste your time. Lady Mary Vivian must
      know more of Miss Sidney, and be better able to judge of the state of her
      heart than I can be. It would not be the part of a friend to excite you to
      persevere in a pursuit that would end in disappointment; but this much,
      before we quit the subject for ever, I feel it my duty to say&mdash;that I
      think Miss Sidney the woman of all others the best suited to your
      character, the most deserving of your love, the most calculated to make
      you exquisitely and permanently happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All that's very true," said Vivian, impatiently; "but, since I can't have
      her, why make me miserable about her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I to understand," resumed Russell, after a long pause, "am I to
      understand that, now you have regained your freedom, you come here with
      the settled purpose of espousing the Lady Sarah Lidhurst?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven forfend!" cried Vivian, starting back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I am to go over again, on this subject, with indefatigable patience
      and in due logical order, all the arguments, moral, prudential, and
      conventional, which I had the labour of laying before you about a
      twelvemonth ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Save yourself the trouble, my dear friend!" said Vivian; "I shall set all
      that upon a right footing immediately, by speaking of the report at once
      to some of the family. I was going to <i>rise to explain</i> this morning,
      when I was with Lady Glastonbury; but I felt a sort of delicacy&mdash;it
      was an awkward time&mdash;and at that moment somebody came into the room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," said Russell, "you are just like the hero of a novel, stopped from
      saying what he ought to say by somebody's coming into the room.&mdash;Awkward
      time! Take care you don't sacrifice yourself at last to these <i>awkwardnesses</i>
      and this sort of <i>delicacies</i>. I have still my fears that you will
      get into difficulties about Lady Sarah."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian could not help laughing at what he called his friend's absurd
      fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you are determined, my dear Russell, at all events to fear for me,
      I'll suggest to you a more reasonable cause of dread. Suppose I should
      fall desperately in love with Lady Julia!&mdash;I assure you there's some
      danger of that. She is really very handsome and very graceful; uncommonly
      clever and eloquent&mdash;as to the rest, you know her&mdash;what is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All that you have said, and more. She might be made any thing&mdash;every
      thing; an ornament to her sex&mdash;an honour to her country&mdash;were
      she under the guidance of persons fit to direct great powers and a noble
      character; but yet I cannot, Vivian, as your friend, recommend her to you
      as a wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not thinking of her as a wife," said Vivian: "I have not had time to
      think of her at all yet. But you said, just now, that in good hands she
      might be made every thing that is good and great. Why not by a husband,
      instead of a governess? and would not you call mine <i>good hands</i>?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good, but not steady&mdash;not at all the husband fit to guide such a
      woman. He must be a man not only of superior sense, but of superior
      strength of mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian was piqued by this remark, and proceeded to compare the fitness of
      his character to <i>such</i> a character as Lady Julia's. Every moment he
      showed more curiosity to hear further particulars of her disposition; of
      the different characters of her governesses, and of all her relations; but
      Russell refused to say more. He had told him what he was called upon, as
      his friend, to reveal; he left the rest to Vivian's own observation and
      judgment. Vivian set himself to work to observe and judge with all his
      might.
    </p>
    <p>
      He soon perceived that all Russell had told him of the mismanagement of
      Lady Julia's education was true. In this house there were two parties,
      each in extremes, and each with their systems and practice carried to the
      utmost excess. The partisans of the old and the new school were here to be
      seen at daggers-drawing. Lady Glastonbury, abhorrent of what she termed
      modern philosophy, and classing under that name almost all science and
      literature, especially all attempts to cultivate the understanding of
      women, had, with the assistance of her <i>double</i>, Miss Strictland,
      brought up Lady Sarah in all the ignorance and all the rigidity of the
      most obsolete of the old school; she had made Lady Sarah precisely like
      herself; with virtue, stiff, dogmatical, and repulsive; with religion,
      gloomy and puritanical; with manners, cold and automatic. In the course of
      eighteen years, whilst Lady Glistonbury went on, like clock-work, the same
      round, punctual to the letter but unfeeling of the spirit of her duties,
      she contrived, even by the wearisome method of her <i>minuted</i> diary of
      education, to make her house odious to her husband. Some task, or master,
      or hour of lesson, continually, and immitigably plagued him: he went
      abroad for amusement, and found dissipation. Thus, by her unaccommodating
      temper, and the obstinacy of her manifold virtues, she succeeded in
      alienating the affections of her husband. In despair he one day exclaimed,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Ah que de vertus vous me faites haïr;"
</pre>
    <p>
      and, repelled by virtue in this ungracious form, he flew to more
      attractive vice. Finding that he could not have any comfort or solace in
      the society of his wife, he sought consolation in the company of a
      mistress. Lady Glistonbury had, in the mean time, her consolation in being
      a pattern-wife; and in hearing that at card-tables it was universally
      said, that Lord Glistonbury was the worst of husbands, and that her
      ladyship was extremely to be pitied. In process of time, Lord Glistonbury
      was driven to his home again by the united torments of a virago mistress
      and the gout. It was at this period that he formed the notion of being at
      once a political leader and a Mecaenas; and it was at this period that he
      became acquainted with both his daughters, and determined that his Julia
      should never resemble the Lady Sarah. He saw his own genius in Julia; and
      he resolved, as he said, to give her fair play, and to make her one of the
      wonders of the age. After some months' counteraction and altercation, Lord
      Glistonbury, with a high hand, took <i>his</i> daughter from under the
      control of Miss Strictland; and, in spite of all the representations,
      prophecies, and denunciations of her mother, consigned Julia to the care
      of a governess after his own heart&mdash;a Miss Bateman; or, as he called
      her, <i>The Rosamunda</i>. From the moment this lady was introduced into
      the family there was an irreconcileable breach between the husband and
      wife. Lady Glistonbury was perfectly in the right in her dread of such a
      governess as Miss Bateman for her daughter. Her ladyship was only
      partially and accidentally right: right in point of fact, but wrong in the
      general principle; for she objected to Miss Bateman, as being of the class
      of literary women; to her real faults, her inordinate love of admiration,
      and romantic imprudence, Lady Glistonbury did not object, because she did
      not at first know them; and when she did, she considered them but as
      necessary consequences of the <i>cultivation and enlargement of Miss
      Bateman's understanding</i>. "No wonder!" her ladyship would say; "I knew
      it must be so; I knew it could not be otherwise. All those clever women,
      as they are called, are the same. This <i>comes</i> of literature and
      literary ladies."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus moralizing in private with Miss Strictland and her own small party,
      Lady Glistonbury appeared silent and passive before her husband and his
      adherents. After prophesying how it all must end in the ruin of her
      daughter Julia, she declared that she would never speak on this subject
      again: she showed herself ready, with maternal resignation, and in silent
      obduracy, to witness the completion of the sacrifice of her devoted child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Glistonbury was quite satisfied with having silenced opposition. His
      new governess, established in her office, and with full and unlimited
      powers, went on triumphant and careless of her charge; she thought of
      little but displaying her own talents in company. The castle was
      consequently filled with crowds of amateurs; novels and plays were the
      order of the day; and a theatre was fitted up, all in open defiance of
      poor Lady Glistonbury. The daughter commenced her new course of education
      by being taught to laugh at her mother's prejudices. Such was the state of
      affairs when Vivian commenced his observations; and all this secret
      history he learnt by scraps, and hints, and inuendoes, from very
      particular friends of both parties&mdash;friends who were not troubled
      with any of Mr. Russell's scruples or discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian's attention was now fixed upon Lady Julia; he observed with
      satisfaction, that, notwithstanding her governess's example and
      excitement, Lady Julia did not show any exorbitant desire for general
      admiration; and that her manners were free from coquetry and affectation:
      she seemed rather to disdain the flattery, and to avoid both the homage
      and the company of men who were her inferiors in mental qualifications;
      she addressed her conversation principally to Vivian and his friend
      Russell; with them, indeed, she conversed a great deal, with much
      eagerness and enthusiasm, expressing all her opinions without disguise,
      and showing on most occasions more imagination than reason, and more
      feeling than judgment. Vivian perceived that it was soon suspected by many
      of their observers, and especially by Lady Glistonbury and the Lady Sarah,
      that Julia had a design upon his heart; but he plainly discerned that she
      had no design whatever to captivate him; and that though she gave him so
      large a share of her company, it was without thinking of him as a lover:
      he saw that she conversed with him and Mr. Russell, preferably to others,
      because they spoke on subjects which interested her more; and because they
      drew out her brother, of whom she was very fond. Her being capable, at so
      early an age, to appreciate Russell's character and talents; her
      preferring his solid sense and his plain sincerity to the brilliancy, the
      <i>fashion</i>, and even the gallantry of all the men whom her father had
      now collected round her, appeared to Vivian the most unequivocal proof of
      the superiority of her understanding and of the goodness of her
      disposition. On various occasions, he marked with delight the deference
      she paid to his friend's opinion, and the readiness with which she
      listened to reason from him&mdash;albeit unused and averse from reason in
      general. Impatient as she was of control, and confident, both in her own
      powers and in her instinctive moral sense (about which, by-the-bye, she
      talked a great deal of eloquent nonsense), yet a word or a look from Mr.
      Russell would reclaim her in her highest flights. Soon after Vivian
      commenced his observations upon this interesting subject, he saw an
      instance of what Russell had told him of the ease with which Lady Julia
      might be guided by a man of sense and strength of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tragedy of "The Fair Penitent," Calista by Miss Bateman, was
      represented with vast applause to a brilliant audience at the Glistonbury
      theatre. The same play was to be reacted a week afterwards to a fresh
      audience&mdash;it was proposed that Vivian should play Lothario, and that
      Lady Julia should play Calista: Miss Bateman saw no objection to this
      proposal: Lord Glistonbury might, perhaps, have had the parental prudence
      to object to his daughter's appearing in public at her age, in such a
      character, before a mixed audience: but, unfortunately, Lady Glistonbury
      bursting from her silence at this critical moment, said so much, and in
      such a prosing and puritanical manner, not only against her daughter's
      acting in this play, and in these circumstances, but against all <i>stage
      plays</i>, playwrights, actors, and actresses whatsoever, denouncing and
      anathematizing them all indiscriminately; that immediately Lord
      Glistonbury laughed&mdash;Miss Bateman took fire&mdash;and it became a
      trial of power between the contending parties. Lady Julia, who had but
      lately escaped from the irksomeness of her mother's injudicious and minute
      control, dreaded, above all things, to be again subjected to her and Miss
      Strictland; therefore, without considering the real propriety or
      impropriety of the point in question, without examining whether Miss
      Bateman was right or wrong in the licence she had granted, Lady Julia
      supported her opinion warmly; and, with all her eloquence, at once
      asserted her own liberty, and defended the cause of the theatre in
      general. She had heard Mr. Russell once speak of the utility of a
      well-regulated public stage; of the influence of good theatric
      representations in forming the taste and rousing the soul to virtue: he
      had shown her Marmontel's celebrated letter to Rousseau on this subject;
      consequently, she thought she knew what his opinion must be on the present
      occasion: therefore she spoke with more than her usual confidence and
      enthusiasm. Her eloquence and her abilities transported her father and
      most of her auditors, Vivian among the rest, with astonishment and
      admiration: she enjoyed, at this moment, what the French call <i>un grand
      succès</i>; but, in the midst of the buzz of applause, Vivian observed
      that her eye turned anxiously upon Russell, who stood silent, and with a
      disapproving countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure your friend, Mr. Russell, is displeased at this instant&mdash;and
      with me.&mdash;I must know why.&mdash;Let us ask him.&mdash;Do bring him
      here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately she disengaged herself from all her admirers, and, making room
      for Mr. Russell beside her, waited, as she said, to hear from him <i>ses
      vérités</i>. Russell would have declined speaking, but her ladyship
      appealed earnestly and urgently for his opinion, saying, "Who will speak
      the truth to me if you will not? On whose judgment can I rely if not on
      yours?&mdash;You direct my brother's mind to every thing that is wise and
      good; direct mine: I am as desirous to do right as he can be: and you will
      find me&mdash;self-willed and volatile, as I know you think me&mdash;you
      will find me a docile pupil. Then tell me frankly&mdash;did I, just now,
      speak too much or too warmly? I thought I was speaking your sentiments,
      and that I <i>must</i> be right. But perhaps it was not right for a woman,
      or so young a woman as I am, to support even just opinions so resolutely.
      And yet is it a crime to be young?&mdash;And is the honour of maintaining
      truth to be monopolized by age?&mdash;No, surely; for Mr. Russell himself
      has not that claim to stand forth, as he so often does, in its defence. If
      you think that I ought not to act Calista; if you think that I had better
      not appear on the stage at all, only say so!&mdash;All I ask is your
      opinion; the advantage of your judgment. And you see, Mr. Vivian, how
      difficult it is to obtain it!&mdash;But his friend, probably, never felt
      this difficulty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With a degree of sober composure, which almost provoked Vivian, Mr.
      Russell answered this animated lady. And with a sincerity which, though
      politely shown, Vivian thought severe and almost cruel, Russell
      acknowledged that her ladyship had anticipated some, but not all of his
      objections. He represented that she had failed in becoming respect to her
      mother, in thus publicly attacking and opposing her opinions, even
      supposing them to be ill-founded; and declared that, as to the case in
      discussion, he was entirely of Lady Glistonbury's opinion, that it would
      be unfit and injurious to a young lady to exhibit herself, even on a
      private stage, in the character in which it had been proposed that Lady
      Julia should appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Russell spoke, Vivian was charmed with the manner in which Lady
      Julia listened: he thought her countenance enchantingly beautiful,
      alternately softened as it was by the expression of genuine humility, and
      radiant with candour and gratitude. She made no reply, but immediately
      went to her mother; and, in the most engaging manner acknowledged that she
      had been wrong, and declared that she was convinced it would be improper
      for her to act the character she had proposed. With that cold haughtiness
      of mien, the most repulsive to a warm and generous mind, the mother turned
      to her daughter, and said that, for her part, she had no faith in sudden
      conversions, and starts of good conduct made little impression upon her;
      that, as far as she was herself concerned, she forgave, as in charity it
      became her, all the undutiful insolence with which she had been treated;
      that, as to the rest, she was glad to find, for Lady Julia's own sake,
      that she had given up her strange, and, as she must say, <i>scandalous</i>
      intentions. "However," added Lady Glistonbury, "I am not so sanguine as to
      consider this as any thing but a respite from ruin; I am not so credulous
      as to believe in sudden reformations; nor, despicable as you and my lord
      do me the honour to think my understanding&mdash;am I to be made the dupe
      of a little deceitful fondling!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia withdrew her arms, which she had thrown round her mother; and Miss
      Strictland, after breaking her netting silk with a jerk of indignation,
      observed, that, for her part, she wondered young ladies should go to
      consult their brother's tutor, instead of more suitable, and, perhaps, as
      competent advisers. Lady Julia, now indignant, turned away, and was
      withdrawing from before the triumvirate, when Lady Sarah, who had sat
      looking, even more stiff and constrained than usual, suddenly broke from
      her stony state, and, springing forward, exclaimed, "Stay, Julia!&mdash;Stay,
      my dear sister!&mdash;Oh, Miss Strictland! do my sister justice!&mdash;When
      Julia is so candid, so eager to do right, intercede for her with my
      mother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "First, may I presume to ask," said Miss Strictland, drawing herself up
      with starch malice; "first, may I presume to ask, whether Mr. Vivian, upon
      this occasion, declined to act Lothario?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Strictland, you do not do my sister justice!" cried Lady Sarah:
      "Miss Strictland, you are wrong&mdash;very wrong!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Strictland, for a moment struck dumb with astonishment, opening her
      eyes as far as they could open, stared at Lady Sarah, and, after a pause,
      exclaimed, "Lady Sarah! I protest I never saw any thing that surprised me
      so much in my whole life!&mdash;&mdash;Wrong!&mdash;very wrong!&mdash;I?&mdash;&mdash;My
      Lady Glistonbury, I trust your ladyship&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Glistonbury, at this instant, showed, by a little involuntary shake
      of her head, that she was inwardly perturbed: Lady Sarah, throwing herself
      upon her knees before her mother, exclaimed, "Oh, madam!&mdash;mother!
      forgive me if I failed in respect to Miss Strictland!&mdash;&mdash;But, my
      sister! my sister&mdash;&mdash;!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rise, Sarah, rise!" said Lady Glistonbury; "that is not a fit attitude!&mdash;And
      you are wrong, very wrong, to fail in respect to Miss Strictland, my
      second self, Sarah. Lady Julia Lidhurst, it is you who are the cause of
      this&mdash;the only failure of duty your sister ever was guilty of towards
      me in the whole course of her life&mdash;I beg of you to withdraw, and
      leave me my daughter Sarah."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At least, I have found a sister, and when I most wanted it," said Lady
      Julia. "I always suspected you loved me, but I never knew how much till
      this moment," added she, turning to embrace her sister; but Lady Sarah had
      now resumed her stony appearance, and, standing motionless, received her
      sister's embrace without sign of life or feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady Julia Lidhurst," said Miss Strictland, "you humble yourself in vain:
      I think your mother, my Lady Glistonbury, requested of you to leave your
      sister, Lady Sarah, to us, and to her duty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Duty!" repeated Lady Julia, her eyes flashing indignation: "Is this what
      you call <i>duty</i>?&mdash;Never will I humble myself before you again&mdash;I
      <i>will</i> leave you&mdash;I do leave you&mdash;now and for ever&mdash;DUTY!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She withdrew:&mdash;and thus was lost one of the fairest occasions of
      confirming a young and candid mind in prudent and excellent dispositions.
      After humbling herself in vain before a mother, this poor young lady was
      now to withstand a father's reproaches; and, after the inexorable Miss
      Strictland, she was to encounter the exasperated Miss Bateman. Whether the
      Gorgon terrors of one governess, or the fury passions of the other, were
      most formidable, it was difficult to decide. Miss Bateman had written an
      epilogue for Lady Julia to recite in the character of Calista; and, with
      the combined irritability of authoress and governess, she was enraged at
      the idea of her pupil's declining to repeat these favourite lines. Lord
      Glistonbury cared not for the lines; but, considering his own authority to
      be impeached by his daughter's resistance, he treated <i>his Julia</i> as
      a traitor to his cause, and a rebel to his party.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lady Julia was resolute in declining to play Calista; and Vivian
      admired the spirit and steadiness of her resistance to the solicitations
      and the flattery with which she was assailed by the numerous hangers-on of
      the family, and by the amateurs assembled at Glistonbury. Russell, who
      knew the warmth of her temper, however, dreaded that she should pass the
      bounds of propriety in the contest with her father and her governess; and
      he almost repented having given any advice upon the subject. The contest
      happily terminated in Lord Glistonbury's having a violent fit of the gout,
      which, as the newspapers informed the public, "ended for the season the
      Christmas hospitalities and theatrical festivities at Glistonbury Castle!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst his lordship suffered this fit of torture, his daughter Julia
      attended him with so much patience and affection, that he forgave her for
      not being willing to be Calista; and, upon his recovery, he announced to
      Miss Bateman that it was his will and pleasure that his daughter Julia
      should do as she liked on this point, but that he desired it to be
      understood that this was no concession to Lady Glistonbury's prejudices,
      but an act of his own pure grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      To celebrate his recovery, his lordship determined to give a ball; and
      Miss Bateman persuaded him to make it a <i>fancy ball</i>. In this family,
      unfortunately, every occurrence, even every proposal of amusement, became
      a subject of dispute and a source of misery. Lady Glistonbury, as soon as
      her lord announced his intention of giving this fancy ball, declined
      taking the direction of an entertainment which approached, she said, too
      near to the nature of a masquerade to meet her ideas of propriety. Lord
      Glistonbury laughed, and tried the powers of ridicule and wit:
    </p>
    <p>
      "But on th'impassive ice the lightnings play'd."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady's cool obstinacy was fully a match for her lord's petulance: to
      all he could urge, she repeated, "that such entertainments did not meet
      her ideas of propriety." Her ladyship, Lady Sarah, and Miss Strictland,
      consequently declared it to be their resolution, "to appear in their own
      proper characters, and their own proper dresses, and no others."
    </p>
    <p>
      These three rigid seceders excepted, all the world at Glistonbury Castle,
      and within its sphere of attraction, were occupied with preparations for
      this ball. Miss Bateman was quite in her element, flattered and
      flattering, consulting and consulted, in the midst of novels, plays, and
      poetry, prints, and pictures, searching for appropriate characters and
      dresses. This preceptress seemed to think and to expect that others should
      deem her office of governess merely a subordinate part of her business:
      she considered her having accepted of the superintendence of the education
      of Lady Julia Lidhurst as a prodigious condescension on her part, and a
      derogation from her rank and pretensions in the literary and fashionable
      world; a peculiar and sentimental favour to Lord Glistonbury, of which his
      lordship was bound in honour to show his sense, by treating her as a
      member of his family, not only with distinguished politeness, but by <i>deferring</i>
      to her opinion in all things, so as to prove to her satisfaction that she
      was considered <i>only</i> as a friend, and not at all as a governess.
      Thus she was raised as much above that station in the family in which she
      could be useful, as governesses in other houses have been sometimes
      depressed below their proper rank. Upon this, as upon all occasions, Miss
      Bateman was the first person to be thought of&mdash;her character and her
      dress were the primary points to be determined; and they were points of no
      easy decision, she having proposed for herself no less than five
      characters&mdash;the fair Rosamond, Joan of Arc, Cleopatra, Sigismunda,
      and Circe. After minute consideration of the dresses, which, at a fancy
      ball, were to constitute these characters, fair Rosamond was rejected,
      "because the old English dress muffled up the person too much; Joan of Arc
      would find her armour inconvenient for dancing; Cleopatra's diadem and
      royal purple would certainly be truly becoming, but then her regal length
      of train was as inadmissible in a dancing-dress as Joan of Arc's armour."
      Between Sigismunda and Circe, Miss Bateman's choice long vibrated. The
      Spanish and the Grecian costume had each its claims on her favour: for she
      was assured they both became her remarkably. Vivian was admitted to the
      consultation: he was informed that there must be both a Circe and a
      Sigismunda; and that Lady Julia was to take whichever of the two
      characters Miss Bateman declined. Pending the deliberation, Lady Julia
      whispered to Vivian, "For mercy's sake! contrive that I may not be doomed
      to be Circe; for Circe is no better than Calista."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian was charmed with her ladyship's delicacy and discretion; he
      immediately decided her governess, by pointing out the beautiful
      head-dress of Flaxman's Circe, and observing that Miss Bateman's hair
      (which was a wig) might easily be arranged, so as to produce the same
      effect. Lady Julia rewarded Vivian for this able and successful manoeuvre
      by one of her sweetest smiles. Her smiles had now powerful influence over
      his heart. He rebelled against Russell's advice, to take more time to
      consider how far his character was suited to hers: he was conscious,
      indeed, that it would be more prudent to wait a little longer before he
      should declare his passion, as Lady Julia was so very young and
      enthusiastic, and as her education had been so ill managed; but he argued
      that the worse her education, and the more imprudent the people about her,
      the greater was her merit in conducting herself with discretion, and in
      trying to restrain her natural enthusiasm. Russell acknowledged this, and
      gave all due praise to Lady Julia; yet still he represented that Vivian
      had been acquainted with her so short time that he could not be a
      competent judge of her temper and disposition, even if his judgment were
      cool; but it was evident that his passions were now engaged warmly in her
      favour. All that Russell urged for delay so far operated, however, upon
      Vivian, that he adopted a half measure, and determined to try what chance
      he might have of pleasing her before he should either declare his love to
      her ladyship, or make his proposal to her father. A favourable opportunity
      soon occurred. On the day appointed for the fancy ball, the young Lord
      Lidhurst, who was to be Tancred, was taken ill of a feverish complaint: he
      was of a very weakly constitution, and his friends were much alarmed by
      his frequent indispositions. His physicians ordered quiet; he was confined
      to his own apartment; and another Tancred was of course to be sought for:
      Vivian ventured to offer to assume the character; and his manner, when he
      made this proposal to his fair Sigismunda, though it was intended to be
      merely polite and gallant, was so much agitated, that she now, for the
      first time, seemed to perceive the state of his heart. Colouring high, her
      ladyship answered, with hesitation unusual to her, "that she believed&mdash;she
      fancied&mdash;that is, she understood from her brother&mdash;that he had
      deputed Mr. Russell to represent Tancred in his place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian was not displeased by this answer: the change of colour and evident
      embarrassment appeared to him favourable omens; and he thought that
      whether the embarrassment arose from unwillingness to let any man but her
      brother's tutor, a man domesticated in the family, appear as her Tancred,
      or whether she was afraid of offending Mr. Russell, by changing the
      arrangement her brother had made; in either case Vivian felt ready, though
      a man in love, to approve of her motives. As to the rest, he was certain
      that Russell would decline the part assigned him; and, as Vivian expected,
      Russell came in a few minutes to resign his pretensions, or rather to
      state that though Lord Lidhurst had proposed it, he had never thought of
      accepting the honour; and that he should, in all probability, not appear
      at the ball, because he was anxious to stay as much as possible with Lord
      Lidhurst, whose indisposition increased instead of abating. Lord
      Glistonbury, after this explanation, came in high spirits, and with much
      satisfaction in his countenance and manner, said he was happy to hear that
      his Sigismunda was to have Mr. Vivian for her Tancred. So far all was
      prosperous to our hero's hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he saw Lady Julia again, which was not till dinner time, he
      perceived an unfavourable alteration in her manner; not the timidity or
      embarrassment of a girl who is uncertain whether she is or is not pleased,
      or whether she should or should not appear to be pleased by the first
      approaches of a new lover; but there was in her manner a decided
      haughtiness, and an unusual air of displeasure and reserve. Though he sat
      beside her, and though in general her delightful conversation had been
      addressed either to him or Mr. Russell, they were now both deprived of
      this honour; whatever she said, and all she said, was unlike herself, was
      directed to persons opposite to her, even to the captain, the lawyer, and
      the family parasites, whose existence she commonly seemed to forget. She
      ate as well as spoke in a hurried manner, and as if in defiance of her
      feelings. Whilst the courses were changing, she turned towards Mr. Vivian,
      and after a rapid examining glance at his countenance, she said, in a low
      voice&mdash;"You must think me, Mr. Vivian, very unreasonable and
      whimsical, but I have given up all thoughts of being Sigismunda. Will you
      oblige me so far as not to appear in the dress of Tancred to-night? You
      will thus spare me all farther difficulty. You know my mother and sister
      have declared their determination not to wear any fancy dress; and though
      my father is anxious that I should, I believe it may be best that, in this
      instance, I follow my own judgment.&mdash;May I expect that you will
      oblige me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian declared his entire submission to her ladyship's judgment: and he
      now was delighted to be able to forgive her for all seeming caprice;
      because he thought he saw an amiable motive for her conduct&mdash;the wish
      not to displease her mother, and not to excite the jealousy of her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour when the ball was to commence arrived; the room filled with
      company; and Vivian, who flattered himself with the pleasure of dancing
      all night with Lady Julia, as the price of his prompt obedience, looked
      round the room in search of his expected partner, but he searched in vain.
      He looked to the door at every new entrance&mdash;no Lady Julia appeared.
      Circe, indeed, was every where to be seen and heard, and an uglier Circe
      never touched this earth; but she looked happily confident in the power of
      her charms. Whilst she was intent upon fascinating Vivian, he was
      impatiently waiting for a moment's intermission of her volubility, that he
      might ask what had become of Lady Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady Julia?&mdash;She's somewhere in the room, I suppose.&mdash;Oh! no: I
      remember, she told me she would go and sit a quarter of an hour with her
      brother. She will soon make her appearance, I suppose; but I am so angry
      with her for disappointing us all, and you in particular, by changing her
      mind about Sigismunda!&mdash;Such a capital Tancred as you would have
      made! and now you are no character at all! But then, you are only on a par
      with certain ladies. Comfort yourself with the great Pope's (I fear too
      true) reflection, that
    </p>

     'Most women have no characters at all.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      Miss Bateman's eye glanced insolently, as she spoke, upon Lady
      Glistonbury's trio, who passed by at this instant, all without fancy
      dresses. Vivian shocked by this ill-breeding towards the mistress of the
      house, offered his arm immediately to Lady Glistonbury, and conducted her
      with Lady Sarah and Miss Strictland to their proper places, where, having
      seated themselves, each in the same attitude precisely, they looked more
      like martyrs prepared for endurance, than like persons in a ball-room.
      Vivian stayed to speak a few words to Lady Glistonbury, and was just going
      away, when her ladyship, addressing him with more than her usual
      formality, said, "Mr. Vivian, I see, has not adopted the fashion of the
      day; and as he is the only gentleman present, whose fancy dress does not
      proclaim him engaged to some partner equally <i>fanciful</i>, I cannot but
      wish that my daughter, Lady Sarah, should, if she dance at all to-night,
      dance with a gentleman in his own proper character."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian, thus called upon, felt compelled to ask the honour of Lady Sarah's
      hand; but he flattered himself, that after the first dance he should have
      done his duty, and that he should be at liberty by the time Julia should
      make her appearance. But, to his great disappointment, Mr. Russell, who
      came in just as he had finished the first two dances, informed him that
      Lady Julia was determined not to appear at the ball, but to stay with her
      brother, who wished for her company. So poor Vivian found himself doomed
      to be Lady Sarah's partner for the remainder of the night. It happened
      that, as he was handing her ladyship to supper, in passing through an
      antechamber where some of the neighbours of inferior rank had been
      permitted to assemble to see <i>the show</i>, he heard one farmer's wife
      say to another, "Who <i>beas</i> that there, that's handing of Lady
      Sarah?"&mdash;They were detained a little by the crowd, so that he had
      time to hear the whole answer.&mdash;"Don't you know?" was the answer.
      "That there gentleman is Mr. Vivian of the new castle, that is to be
      married to her directly, and that's what he's come here for; for they've
      been engaged to one another ever since the time o' the election."
    </p>
    <p>
      This speech disturbed our hero's mind considerably; for it awakened a
      train of reflections which he had wilfully left dormant. Will it, can it
      be believed, that after all his friend Russell's exhortations, after his
      own wise resolutions, he had never yet made any of those explanatory
      speeches he had intended?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Positively," said he to himself, "this report shall not prevail
      four-and-twenty hours longer. I will propose for Lady Julia Lidhurst
      before I sleep. Russell, to be sure, advises me not to be precipitate&mdash;to
      take more time to study her disposition; but I am acquainted with her
      sufficiently;" (he should have said, I am in love with her sufficiently;)
      "and really now, I am bound in honour immediately to declare myself&mdash;it
      is the best possible way of putting a stop to a report which will be
      ultimately injurious to Lady Sarah."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Vivian made his past irresolution an excuse for his present
      precipitation, flattering himself, as men often do when they are yielding
      to the impulse of their passions, that they are submitting to the dictates
      of reason. At six o'clock in the morning the company dispersed. Lord
      Glistonbury and Vivian were the last in the ball-room. His lordship began
      some raillery upon our hero's having declined appearing as Tancred, and
      upon his having devoted himself all night to Lady Sarah. Vivian seized the
      moment to explain his real feelings, and he made his proposal for Lady
      Julia. It was received with warm approbation by the father, who seemed to
      rejoice the more in this proposal, because he knew that it would
      disappoint and mortify Lady Glistonbury. The interests of his hatred
      seemed, indeed, to occupy his lordship more than the interests of Vivian's
      love; but politeness threw a decent veil over these feelings; and, after
      saying all that could be expected of the satisfaction it must be to a
      father to see his daughter united to a man of Mr. Vivian's family,
      fortune, talents, and great respectability; and after having given,
      incidentally and parenthetically, his opinions, not only concerning
      matrimony, but concerning all other affairs of human life, he wished his
      future son-in-law a very good night, and left him to repose. But no rest
      could Vivian take&mdash;he waited with impatience, that made every hour
      appear at least two, for the time when he was again to meet Lady Julia. He
      saw her at breakfast; but he perceived by her countenance that she as yet
      knew nothing of his proposal. After breakfast Lord Glistonbury said, "Come
      with me, my little Julia! it is a long time since I've had a walk and a
      talk with you." His lordship paced up and down the terrace, conversing
      earnestly with her for some time: he then went on to some labourers, who
      were cutting down a tree at the farther end of the avenue. Vivian hastened
      out to meet Lady Julia, who, after standing deep in thought for some
      moments, seemed returning towards the castle.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Mr. Vivian, I trust that I am not deficient in maidenly modesty," said
      Lady Julia, "when it is not incompatible with what I deem a higher virtue&mdash;sincerity.
      Now and ever, frankness is, and shall be, my only policy. The confidence I
      am about to repose in you, sir, is the strongest proof of my esteem, and
      of the gratitude I feel for your attachment.&mdash;My heart is no longer
      in my power to bestow. It is&mdash;young as I am, I dare to pronounce the
      words&mdash;irrevocably fixed upon one who will do honour to my choice.
      Your proposal was made to my father&mdash;Why was it not made to me?&mdash;Men&mdash;all
      men but one&mdash;treat women as puppets, and then wonder that they are
      not rational creatures!&mdash;Forgive me this too just reproach. But, as I
      was going to say, your proposal has thrown me into great difficulties&mdash;the
      greater because my father warmly approves of it. I have a strong affection
      for him; and, perhaps, a year or two ago, I should, in the ignorance in
      which I was dogmatically brought up, have thought it my duty to submit
      implicitly to parental authority, and to receive a husband from the hands
      of a father, without consulting either my own heart or my own judgment.
      But, since my mind has been more enlightened, and has opened to higher
      views of the dignity of my sex, and higher hopes of happiness, my ideas of
      duty have altered; and, I trust, I have sufficient courage to support my
      own idea of the rights of my sex, and my firm conviction of what is just
      and becoming."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian was again going to say something; but, whether against or in favour
      of the rights of the sex, he had not clearly decided; when her ladyship
      saved him the trouble, by proceeding with the train of her ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My sincerity towards my father will, perhaps, cost me dear; but I cannot
      repent of it. As soon as I knew the state of my own heart&mdash;which was
      not till very lately&mdash;which was not, indeed, till you gave me reason
      to think you seriously liked me&mdash;I openly told my father all I knew
      of my own heart. Would you believe it?&mdash;I am sure I should not,
      unless I had seen and felt it&mdash;my father, who, you know, professes
      the most liberal opinions possible; my father, who, in conversation is
      'All for love, and the world well lost;' my father, who let Miss Bateman
      put the Heloise into my hands, was astonished, shocked, indignant, at his
      own daughter's confession, I should say, assertion of her preference of a
      man of high merit, who wants only the advantages, if they be advantages,
      of rank and fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Vivian," continued she, "may I hope that now, when you must be
      convinced of the inefficacy of any attempt either to win or to control my
      affections, you will have the generosity to spare me all unnecessary
      contest with my father? It must render him more averse from the only union
      that can make his daughter happy; and it may ruin the fortunes of&mdash;the
      first, in my opinion, of human beings. I will request another favour from
      you&mdash;and let my willingness to be obliged by you convince you that I
      appreciate your character&mdash;I request that you will not only keep
      secret all that I have said to you; but that, if accident, or your own
      penetration, should hereafter discover to you the object of my affection,
      you will refrain from making any use of that discovery to my disadvantage.
      You see how entirely I have thrown myself on your honour and generosity."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian assured her that the appeal was powerful with him; and that, by
      mastering his own passions, and sacrificing his feelings to hers, he would
      endeavour to show his strong desire to secure, at all events, her
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are truly generous, Mr. Vivian, to listen to me with indulgence, to
      wish for my happiness, whilst I have been wounding your feelings. But,
      without any impeachment of your sincerity, or yet of your sensibility, let
      me say, that yours will be only a transient disappointment. Your
      acquaintance with me is but of yesterday, and the slight impression made
      on your mind will soon be effaced; but upon my mind there has been time to
      grave a deep, a first charactery of love, that never, whilst memory holds
      her seat, can be erased.&mdash;I believe," said Julia, checking herself,
      whilst a sudden blush overspread her countenance&mdash;"I am afraid that I
      have said too much, too much for a woman. The fault of my character, I
      know, I have been told, is the want of what is called RESERVE."
    </p>
    <p>
      Blushing still more deeply as she pronounced these last words, the colour
      darting up to her temples, spreading over her neck, and making its way to
      the very tips of her fingers, "Now I have done worse," cried she, covering
      her face with her hands. But the next moment, resuming, or trying to
      resume her self-possession, she said, "It is time that I should retire,
      now that I have revealed my whole heart to you. It has, perhaps, been
      imprudently opened; but for that, your generosity, sir, is to blame. Had
      you shown more selfishness, I should assuredly have exerted more prudence,
      and have treated you with less confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Julia quitted him, and Vivian remained in a species of amaze, from
      which he could not immediately recover. Her frankness, her magnanimity,
      her enthusiastic sensibility, her eloquent beauty, had altogether exalted,
      to the highest ecstasy, his love and admiration. Then he walked about,
      beating his breast in despair at the thought of her affections being
      irrecoverably engaged,&mdash;next quarrelled with the boldness of the
      confession, the <i>assertion</i> of her love&mdash;then decided, that,
      with all her shining qualities and noble dispositions, she was not exactly
      the woman a man should desire for a wife: there was something too rash,
      too romantic about her; there was in her character, as she herself had
      said, and as Russell had remarked, too little <i>reserve</i>. Something
      like jealousy and distrust of his friend arose in Vivian's mind: "What!"
      said he to himself, "and is Russell my rival? and has he been all this
      time in secret my rival? Is it possible that Russell has been practising
      upon the affections of this innocent young creature&mdash;confided to him
      too? All this time, whilst he has been cautioning me against her charms,
      beseeching me not to propose for her precipitately, is it possible that he
      wanted only to get, to keep the start of me?&mdash;No&mdash;impossible!
      utterly impossible! If all the circumstances, all the evidence upon earth
      conspired, I would not believe it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Resolved not to do injustice, even in his inmost soul, to his friend, our
      hero repelled all suspicion of Russell, by reflecting on his long and
      tried integrity, and on the warmth and fidelity of his friendship. In this
      temper he was crossing the castle-yard to go to Russell's apartment, when
      he was met and stopped by one of the domesticated friends of the family,
      Mr. Mainwaring, the young lawyer: he was in the confidence of Lord
      Glistonbury, and, proud to show it, he let Mr. Vivian know that he was
      apprised of the proposal that had been made, and congratulated him, and
      all the parties concerned, on the prospect of such an agreeable connexion.
      Vivian was quite unprepared to speak to any one, much less to a lawyer,
      upon this subject; he had not even thought of the means of obeying Lady
      Julia, by withdrawing his suit; therefore, with a mixture of vexation and
      embarrassment in his manner, he answered in commonplace phrases, meant to
      convey no precise meaning, and endeavoured to disengage himself from his
      companion; but the lawyer, who had fastened upon him, linking his arm in
      Vivian's, continued to walk him up and down under the great gateway,
      saying that he had a word or two of importance for his private ear. This
      man had taken much pains to insinuate himself into Vivian's favour, by the
      most obsequious and officious attentions: though his flattery had at first
      been disgusting, yet, by persevering in his show of civility, he had at
      length inclined Vivian to think that he was too harsh in his first
      judgment, and to believe that, "after all, Mainwaring was a good friendly
      fellow, though his manner was against him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mainwaring, with many professions of regard for Vivian, and with
      sundry premisings that he hazarded himself by the communication, took the
      liberty of hinting, that he guessed, from Mr. Vivian's manner this
      morning, that obstacles had arisen on the part of a young lady who should
      be nameless; and he should make bold to add that, in his private opinion,
      the said obstacles would never be removed whilst <i>a certain person</i>
      remained in the castle, and whilst the young lady alluded to was allowed
      to spend so much of her time studying with her brother when well, or
      nursing him when sick. Mr. Mainwaring declared that he was perfectly
      astonished at Lord Glistonbury's blindness or imprudence in keeping this
      person in the house, after the hints his lordship had received, and after
      all the proofs that must or may have fallen within his cognizance, of the
      arts of seduction that had been employed. Here Vivian interrupted Mr.
      Mainwaring, to beg that he would not keep him longer in suspense by <i>inuendoes</i>,
      but that he would name distinctly the object of his suspicions. This,
      however, Mr. Mainwaring begged to be excused from doing: he would only
      shake his head and smile, and leave people to their own sagacity and
      penetration. Vivian warmly answered, that, if Mr. Mainwaring meant Mr.
      Russell, he was well assured that Mr. Mainwaring was utterly mistaken in
      attributing to him any but the most honourable conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mainwaring smiled, and shook his head&mdash;smiled again, and sighed,
      and hoped Mr. Vivian was right, and observed that time would show; and
      that, at all events, he trusted Mr. Vivian would keep profoundly secret
      the hint which his friendship had, indiscreetly perhaps, hazarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had Mr. Mainwaring retired, when Captain Pickering met and seized
      upon Vivian, led to the same subject, and gave similar hints, that Russell
      was the happy rival who had secretly made himself master of Lady Julia's
      heart. Vivian, though much astonished, finding that these gentlemen agreed
      in their discoveries or their suspicions, still defended his friend
      Russell, and strongly protested that he would be responsible for his
      honour with his life, if it were necessary. The captain shrugged his
      shoulders, said it was none of his business, that, as Mr. Vivian <i>took
      it up so warmly,</i> he should let it drop; for it was by no means his
      intention to get into a quarrel with Mr. Vivian, for whom he had a
      particular regard. This said, with all the frankness of a soldier, Captain
      Pickering withdrew, adding, as the clergyman passed at this instant,
      "There's a man who could tell you more than any of us, if he would, but <i>snug's</i>
      the word with Wicksted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian, in great anxiety and much curiosity, appealed to Mr. Wicksted: he
      protested that he knew nothing, suspected nothing, at least could venture
      to say nothing; for these were very delicate family matters, and every
      gentleman should, on these occasions, make it a principle to see with his
      own eyes. Gradually, however, Mr. Wicksted let out his opinion, and
      implied infinitely more than Captain Pickering or Mr. Mainwaring had
      asserted. Vivian still maintained, in the warmest terms, that it was
      impossible his friend Russell should be to blame. Mr. Wicksted simply
      pronounced the word <i>friend</i> with a peculiar emphasis, and, with an
      incredulous smile, left him to his reflections. Those reflections were
      painful; for, though he defended Russell from the attacks of others, yet
      he had not sufficient firmness of mind completely to resist the
      suggestions of suspicion and jealousy, particularly when they had been
      corroborated by so many concurring testimonies. He had no longer the
      courage to go immediately to Russell, to tell him of his proposal for Lady
      Julia, or to speak to him of any of his secret feelings; but, turning away
      from the staircase that led to his friend's apartment, he determined to
      observe Russell with his own eyes, before he should decide upon the truth
      or falsehood of the accusations which had been brought against him. Alas!
      Vivian was no longer in a condition to observe with his own eyes; his
      imagination was so perturbed, that he could neither see nor hear any thing
      as it really was. When he next saw Russell and Lady Julia together, he
      wondered at his blindness in not having sooner perceived their mutual
      attachment: notwithstanding that Lady Julia had now the strongest motives
      to suppress every indication of her passion, symptoms of it broke out
      continually, the more violent, perhaps, from her endeavours to conceal
      them. He knew that she was passionately in love with Russell; and that
      Russell should not have perceived what every other man, even every
      indifferent spectator, had discovered, appeared incredible. Russell's calm
      manner and entire self-possession sometimes provoked Vivian, and sometimes
      quelled his suspicions; sometimes he looked upon this calmness as the
      extreme of art, sometimes as a proof of innocence, which could not be
      counterfeit. At one moment he was so much struck with Russell's friendly
      countenance, that, quite ashamed of his suspicions, he was upon the point
      of speaking openly to him; but, unfortunately, these intentions were
      frustrated by some slight obstacle. At length Miss Strictland, who had
      lately been very courteous to Mr. Vivian, took an opportunity of drawing
      him into one of the recessed windows; where, with infinite difficulty in
      bringing herself to speak on such a subject, after inconceivable bridlings
      of the head, and contortions of every muscle of her neck, she insinuated
      to him her fears, that my Lord Glistonbury's confidence had been very ill
      placed in Lord Lidhurst's tutor: she was aware that Mr. Russell had the
      honour of Mr. Vivian's friendship, but nothing could prevent her from
      speaking, where she felt it to be so much her duty; and that, as from the
      unfortunate circumstances in the family she had no longer any influence
      over Lady Julia Lidhurst, nor any chance of being listened to on such a
      subject with patience by Lord Glistonbury, she thought the best course she
      could take was to apply to Mr. Russell's friend, who might possibly, by
      his interference, prevent the utter disgrace and ruin of one branch of a
      noble family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Strictland, in all she said, hinted not at Vivian's attachment to
      Lady Julia, and gave him no reason to believe that she was apprised of his
      having proposed for her ladyship: she spoke with much moderation and
      candour; attributed all Lady Julia's errors to the imprudence of her new
      governess, Miss Bateman. Miss Strictland now showed a desire not to make,
      but to prevent mischief; even the circumlocutions and stiffness of her
      habitual prudery did not, on this occasion, seem unseasonable; therefore
      what she suggested made a great impression on Vivian. He still, however,
      defended Russell, and assured Miss Strictland that, from the long
      experience he had himself had of his friend's honour, he was convinced
      that no temptation could shake his integrity. Miss Strictland had formed
      her opinion on this point, she said, and it would be in vain to argue
      against it. Every new assertion; the belief of each new person who spoke
      to him on the subject; the combination, the coincidence of all their
      opinions, wrought his mind to such a height of jealousy, that he was now
      absolutely incapable of using his reason. He went in search of Russell,
      but in no fit mood to speak to him as he ought. He looked for him in his
      own, in Lord Lidhurst's apartment, in every sitting-room in the castle;
      but Mr. Russell was not to be found: at last Lady Sarah's maid, who heard
      him inquiring for Mr. Russell from the servants, told him, "she fancied
      that if he took the trouble to go to the west walk, he might find Mr.
      Russell, as that was a favourite walk of his." Vivian hurried thither,
      with a secret expectation of finding Lady Julia with him&mdash;there they
      both were in earnest conversation: as he approached, the trees concealed
      him from view; and Vivian heard his own name repeated. "Stop!" cried he,
      advancing: "let me not overhear your secrets&mdash;I am not a traitor to
      my friends!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, his eyes fixed with an expression of concentrated rage upon
      Russell. Terrified by Vivian's sudden appearance and strange address, and
      still more by the fierce look he cast on Russell, Lady Julia started and
      uttered a faint scream. With astonishment, but without losing his
      self-command, Russell advanced towards Vivian, saying, "You are out of
      your senses, my dear friend!&mdash;I will not listen to you in your
      present humour. Take a turn or two with me to cool yourself. The anger of
      a friend should always be allowed three minutes' grace, at least," added
      Russell, smiling, and endeavouring to draw Vivian away: but Vivian stood
      immoveable; Russell's calmness, instead of bringing him to his senses,
      only increased his anger; to his distempered imagination this coolness
      seemed perfidious dissimulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot deceive me longer, Mr. Russell, by all your art!" cried he.
      "Though I am the last to open my eyes, I have opened them. Why did you
      pretend to be my counsellor and friend, when you were my rival?&mdash;when
      you knew that you were my successful rival?&mdash;&mdash;Yes, start and
      affect astonishment! Yes&mdash;look, if you can, with <i>innocent</i>
      surprise upon that lady!&mdash;Say that you have not betrayed her father's
      confidence!&mdash;say, that you have not practised upon her unguarded
      heart!&mdash;say, that you do not know that she loves you to distraction!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Mr. Vivian, what have you done?" cried Lady Julia: she could say no
      more, but fell senseless on the ground. Vivian's anger was at once sobered
      by this sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have I done!" repeated he, as they raised her from the ground.
      "Wretch! dishonourable villain that I am! I have betrayed her secret&mdash;But
      I thought every body knew it!&mdash;&mdash;Is it possible that <i>you</i>
      did not know it, Russell?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Russell made no reply, but ran to the river which was near them for some
      water&mdash;Vivian was incapable of affording any assistance, or even of
      forming a distinct idea. As soon as Lady Julia returned to her senses,
      Russell withdrew; Vivian threw himself on his knees before her, and said
      something about the violence of his passion&mdash;his sorrow&mdash;and her
      forgiveness. "Mr. Vivian," said Lady Julia, turning to him with a mixture
      of despair and dignity in her manner, "do not kneel to me; do not make use
      of any commonplace phrases&mdash;I cannot, at this moment, forgive you&mdash;you
      have done me an irreparable injury. I confided a secret to you&mdash;a
      secret known to no human being but my father and yourself&mdash;you have
      revealed it, and to whom?&mdash;Sooner would I have had it proclaimed to
      the whole world than to &mdash;&mdash;; for what is the opinion of the
      whole world to me, compared to his?&mdash;Sir, you have done me, indeed,
      an irremediable injury!&mdash;I trusted to your honour&mdash;your
      discretion&mdash;and you have betrayed, sacrificed me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vile suspicions!" cried Vivian, striking his forehead: "how could I
      listen to them for a moment!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suspicions of Mr. Russell!" cried Julia, with a look of high indignation&mdash;"Suspicions
      of your noble-minded friend!&mdash;What wickedness, or what weakness!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Weakness!&mdash;miserable weakness!&mdash;the sudden effect of jealousy;
      and could you know, Lady Julia, by what means, by what arts, my mind was
      worked up to this insanity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot listen to this now, Mr. Vivian," interrupted Lady Julia: "my
      thoughts cannot fix upon such things&mdash;I cannot go back to the past&mdash;what
      is done cannot be undone&mdash;what has been said cannot be unsaid.&mdash;You
      cannot recall your words&mdash;they were heard&mdash;they were understood.
      I beg you to leave me, sir, that I may have leisure to <i>think</i>&mdash;if
      possible, to consider what yet remains for me to do. I have no friend&mdash;none,
      none willing or capable of advising me! I begged of you to leave me, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian could not, at this moment, decide whether he ought or ought not to
      tell Lady Julia that her secret was known, or at least suspected, by many
      individuals of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a servant on the terrace who seems to be looking for us," said
      Vivian; "I had something of consequence to say&mdash;but this man&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lady, Miss Bateman desired me to let you know, my lady, that there is
      the Lady Playdels, and the colonel, and Sir James, in the drawing-room,
      just come;&mdash;and she begs, my lady, you will be pleased to come to
      them; for Miss Bateman's waiting for you, my lady, to repeat the verses,
      she bid me say, my lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go to them, Mr. Vivian; I cannot go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lady," persisted the footman, "my lord himself begged you to come; and
      he and all the gentlemen have been looking for you every where."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Return to my father, then, and say that I am coming immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forced into company!" thought Lady Julia, as she walked slowly towards
      the house; "compelled to appear calm and gay, when my heart is&mdash;what
      a life of dissimulation! How unworthy of me, formed, as I was once
      pronounced to be, for every thing that is good and great!&mdash;But I am
      no longer mistress of myself&mdash;no soul left but for one object. Why
      did I not better guard my heart?&mdash;No!&mdash;rather, why can I not
      follow its dictates, and at once avow and justify its choice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian interrupted Lady Julia's reverie by pointing out to her, as they
      passed along the terrace, a group of heads, in one of the back windows of
      the castle, that seemed to be watching them very earnestly. Miss
      Strictland's face was foremost; half her body was out of the window; and
      as she drew back, they heard her say&mdash;"It is not he!&mdash;It is not
      he!"&mdash;As they passed another front of the castle, another party
      seemed to be upon the watch at a staircase window;&mdash;the lawyer, the
      captain, the clergyman's heads appeared for a moment, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They seem all to be upon the watch for us," said Vivian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Meanness!" cried Lady Julia. "To watch or to be watched, I know not which
      is most degrading; but I cannot think they are watching us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Lady Julia!&mdash;yet let me call you dear this once&mdash;my
      hopes are gone!&mdash;even for your forgiveness I have no right to hope&mdash;but
      let me do you one piece of service&mdash;let me put your open temper on
      its guard. You flatter yourself that the secret you confided to me is not
      known to any body living but to your father&mdash;I have reason to believe
      that it is suspected, if not positively known, by several other persons in
      this castle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am certain, too certain, of what I say."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Julia made a sudden stop; and, after a pause, exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then farewell hope! and, with hope, farewell fear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lady, my lord sent me again, for my lord's very impatient for you, my
      lady," said the same footman, returning. Lord Glistonbury met them in the
      hall.&mdash;"Why, Julia! where have you been all this time?" he began, in
      an imperious tone; but seeing Mr. Vivian, his brow grew smooth and his
      voice good-humoured instantly.&mdash;"Ha!&mdash;So! so!&mdash;Hey! well!&mdash;All
      right! all right!&mdash;Good girl! good girl!&mdash;Time for every thing&mdash;Hey!
      Mr. Vivian?&mdash;'Que la solitude est charmante!' as Voltaire says&mdash;Beg
      pardon for sending for you; but interruption, you know, prevents <i>têtes-à-têtes</i>
      on the stage from growing tiresome; and the stage, they say, holds the
      mirror up to nature. But there's no nature now left to hold the mirror up
      to, except in a few odd instances, as in my Julia here!&mdash;Where so
      fast, my blushing darling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you wished, sir, that I should go to Lady Playdel and Sir
      James."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, ay, I sent for you to repeat those charming verses for them that I
      could not clearly remember.&mdash;Go up! go up!&mdash;We'll follow you!&mdash;We
      have a word or two to say about something&mdash;that's nothing to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Glistonbury kept Vivian for a full hour in a state of considerable
      embarrassment, talking to him of Lady Julia, implying that she was
      favourably disposed towards him, but that she had a little pride, that
      might make her affect the contrary at first. Then came a disquisition on
      pride, with quotations and commonplaces;&mdash;then an eulogium, by his
      lordship, on his lordship's own knowledge of the human heart, and more
      especially of that "moving toyshop," the female heart; then anecdotes
      illustrative, comprising the gallantries of thirty years in various ranks
      of life, with suitable bon-mots and embellishments;&mdash;then a little
      French sentiment, by way of moral, with some philosophical axioms, to show
      that, though he had led such a gay life, he had been a deep thinker, and
      that, though nobody could have thought that he had had time for reading,
      his genius had supplied him, he could not himself really tell how, with
      what other people with the study of years could not master:&mdash;all
      which Vivian was compelled to hear, whilst he was the whole time impatient
      to get away, that he might search for Mr. Russell, with whom he was
      anxious to have an explanation. But, at last, when Lord Glistonbury set
      him free, he was not nearer to his object. Mr. Russell, he found upon
      inquiry, had not returned to the castle, nor did he return to dinner; he
      sent word that he was engaged to dine with a party of gentlemen at a
      literary club, in a country town nine miles distant. Vivian spent the
      greatest part of the evening in Lord Lidhurst's apartment, expecting
      Russell's return; but it grew so late, that Lord Lidhurst, who was still
      indisposed, went to bed; and when Vivian quitted his lordship, he met
      Russell's servant in the gallery, who said his master had been come in an
      hour ago: "but, sir," added the man, "my master won't let you see him, I
      am sure; for he would not let me in, and he said, that, if you asked for
      him, I was to answer, that he could not see you to-night."&mdash;Vivian
      knocked in vain at Russell's door; he could not gain admission; so he went
      reluctantly to bed, determined to rise very early, that he might see his
      friend as soon as possible, obtain his forgiveness for the past, and ask
      his advice for the future.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Suspense, curiosity, love, jealousy, remorse, any one of which is enough
      to keep a person awake all night, by turns agitated poor Vivian so
      violently, that for several hours he could not close his eyes; but at
      last, when quite exhausted, he fell into a profound sleep. The first image
      that came before his mind, when he awoke in the morning, was that of Lady
      Julia; his next recollection was of Russell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Mr. Russell up yet?" said Vivian to his servant, who was bringing in
      his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Up, sir! Oh, yes, hours ago!&mdash;He was <i>off</i> at daybreak!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Off!" cried Vivian, starting up in his bed; "off!&mdash;Where is he
      gone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't say, sir. Yes, indeed, sir, I heard Mr. Russell's man say, that
      his master was going post to the north, to some old uncle that was taken
      ill, which he heard about at dinner from some of those gentlemen where he
      dined yesterday; but I can't say positively. But here's a letter he left
      for you with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A letter!&mdash;Give it me!&mdash;Why didn't you give it me sooner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why really, sir, you lay so sound, I didn't care to waken you; and I was
      up so late myself, too, last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave me now; I'll ring when I want you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "TO C. VIVIAN, ESQ.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would not see you, after what passed yesterday, because I feared that I
      should not speak to you with temper. Lest you should misinterpret any
      thing I have formerly said, I must now solemnly assure you, that I never
      had the slightest suspicion of the secret you revealed to me till the
      moment when it was betrayed by your indiscretion. Still I can scarcely
      credit what appears to me so improbable; but, even under this uncertainty,
      I think it my duty to leave this family. Had the slightest idea of what
      you suggested ever crossed my imagination, I should then have acted as I
      do now. I say this, not to justify myself, but to convince you, that what
      I formerly hinted about reserve of manners and prudence was merely a <i>general
      reflection</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For my own part, I seem to act HEROICALLY; but I must disclaim that
      applause to which I am not entitled. All powerful as the temptation must
      appear to you, dangerous as it must have been, in other circumstances, to
      me, I cannot claim any merit for resisting its influence. My safety I owe
      neither to my own prudence or fortitude. I must now, Vivian, impart to you
      a secret which you are at liberty to confide where and when you think
      necessary&mdash;my heart is, and has long been, engaged. Whilst you were
      attached to Miss Sidney, I endeavoured to subdue my love for her; and
      every symptom of it was, I hope and believe, suppressed. This declaration
      cannot now give you any pain; except so far as it may, perhaps, excite in
      your mind some remorse for having unwarrantably, unworthily, and weakly,
      suffered yourself to feel suspicions of a true friend. Well as I know the
      infirmity of your character, and willing as I have always been to make
      allowance for a fault which I thought time and experience would correct, I
      was not prepared for this last stroke; I never thought your weakness of
      mind would have shown itself in suspicion of your best, your long-tried
      friend.&mdash;But I am at last convinced that your mind is not strong
      enough for confidence and friendship. I pity, but I see that I can no
      longer serve; and I feel that I can no longer esteem you. Farewell!
      Vivian. May you find a friend, who will supply to you the place of H.
      RUSSELL."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian knew Russell's character too well to flatter himself that the
      latter part of this letter was written in anger that would quickly
      subside; from the tone of the letter he felt that Russell was deeply
      offended. In the whole course of his life he had depended on Russell's
      friendship as a solid blessing, of which he could never be deprived by any
      change of circumstances&mdash;by any possible chance in human affairs; and
      now to have lost such a friend by his own folly, by his own weakness, was
      a misfortune of which he could hardly believe the reality. At the same
      moment, too, he learned how nobly Russell had behaved towards him, in the
      most trying situation in which the human heart can be placed. Russell's
      love for Selina Sidney, Vivian had never till this instant suspected.
      "What force, what command of mind!&mdash;What magnanimity!&mdash;What a
      generous friend he has ever been to me!&mdash;and I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Vivian, always sinning and always penitent, was so much absorbed by
      sorrow for the loss of Russell's friendship, that he could not for some
      time think even of the interests of his love, or consider the advantage
      which he might derive from the absence of his rival, and from that rival's
      explicit declaration, that his affections were irrevocably engaged. By
      degrees these ideas rose clearly to Vivian's view; his hopes revived. Lady
      Julia would see the absolute impossibility of Russell's returning, or of
      his accepting her affection; her good sense, her pride, would in time
      subdue this hopeless passion; and Vivian was generous enough, or
      sufficiently in love, to feel that the value of her heart would not be
      diminished, but rather increased in his opinion, by the sensibility she
      had shown to the talents and virtues of his friend. <i>His friend</i>,
      Vivian ventured now to call him; for with the hopes of love, the hopes of
      friendship rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All may yet be well!" said he to himself. "Russell will forgive me when
      he hears how I was worked upon by those parasites and prudish busybodies,
      who infused their vile suspicions into my mind. Weak as it is, I never
      will allow that it is incapable of confidence or of friendship!&mdash;No!
      Russell will retract that harsh sentence. When he is happy, as I am sure I
      ardently hope he will be, in Selina's love, he will restore me to his
      favour. Without his friendship, I could not be satisfied with myself, or
      happy in the full accomplishment of all my other fondest hopes."
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time that hope had thus revived and renovated our hero's soul; by
      the time that his views of things had totally changed, and that the colour
      of his future destiny had turned from black to white&mdash;from all gloom
      to all sunshine; the minute-hand of the clock had moved with unfeeling
      regularity, or, in plain unmeasured prose, it was now eleven o'clock, and
      three times Vivian had been warned that breakfast was ready. When he
      entered the room, the first thing he heard, as usual, was Miss Bateman's
      voice, who was declaiming upon some sentimental point, in all "the high
      sublime of deep absurd." Vivian, little interested in this display, and
      joining neither in the open flattery nor in the secret ridicule with which
      the gentlemen wits and amateurs listened to the Rosamunda, looked round
      for Lady Julia. "She breakfasts in her own room this morning," whispered
      Lord Glistonbury, before Vivian had even pronounced her ladyship's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So!" said Mr. Pickering, "we have lost Mr. Russell this morning!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Lord Glistonbury, "he was forced to hurry away to the north, I
      find, to an old sick uncle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord Lidhurst, I'm afraid, will break his heart for want of him," cried
      the lawyer, in a tone that might either pass for earnest or irony,
      according to the fancy of the interpreter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord Lidhurst, did you say?"&mdash;cried the captain: "are you sure you
      meant Lord Lidhurst? I don't apprehend that a young nobleman ever broke
      his heart after his tutor. But I was going to remark&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      What farther the captain was going to remark can never be known to the
      world; for Lord Glistonbury so startled him by the loud and rather angry
      tone in which he called for the cream, which <i>stood</i> with the
      captain, that all his few ideas were put to flight. Mr. Pickering, who
      noticed Lord Glistonbury's displeasure, now resumed the conversation about
      Mr. Russell in a new tone; and the lawyer and he joined in a eulogy upon
      that gentleman. Lord Glistonbury said not a word, but looked embarrassed.
      Miss Strictland cleared her throat several times, and looked infinitely
      more rigid and mysterious than usual. Lady Glistonbury and Lady Sarah,
      ditto&mdash;ditto. Almost every body, except such visitors as were
      strangers at the castle, perceived that there was something extraordinary
      going on in the family; and the gloom and constraint spread so, that,
      towards the close of breakfast, nothing was uttered, by prudent people,
      but awkward sentences about the weather&mdash;the wind&mdash;and the
      likelihood of there being a mail from the continent. Still through all
      this, regardless and unknowing of it all, the Rosamunda talked on, happily
      abstracted, egotistically secured from the pains of sympathy or of
      curiosity by the all-sufficient power of vanity. Even her patron, Lord
      Glistonbury, was at last provoked and disgusted. He was heard, under his
      breath, to pronounce a contemptuous <i>Pshaw!</i> and, as he rose from the
      breakfast table he whispered to Vivian, "There's a woman, now, who thinks
      of nothing living but herself!&mdash;All talkèe talkèe!&mdash;I begin to
      be weary of her.&mdash;&mdash;Gentlemen," continued his lordship, "I've
      letters to write this morning.&mdash;&mdash;You'll ride&mdash;you'll walk&mdash;you're
      for the billiard-room, I suppose.&mdash;&mdash;Mr. Vivian, I shall find
      you in my study, I hope, an hour hence; but first I have a little business
      to settle." With evident embarrassment Lord Glistonbury retired. Lady
      Glistonbury, Lady Sarah, and Miss Strictland, each sighed; then, with
      looks of intelligence, rose and retired. The company separated soon
      afterwards; and went to ride, to walk, or to the billiard-room, and Vivian
      to the study, to wait there for Lord Glistonbury, and to meditate upon
      what might be the nature of his lordship's business. As Vivian crossed the
      gallery, the door of Lady Glistonbury's dressing-room opened, and was shut
      again instantaneously by Miss Strictland; but not before he saw Lady Julia
      kneeling at her father's feet, whilst Lady Glistonbury and Lady Sarah were
      standing like statues, on each side of his lordship. Vivian waited a full
      hour afterwards in tedious suspense in the study. At last he heard doors
      open and footsteps, and he judged that the family council had broken up;
      he laid down a book, of which he had read the same page over six times,
      without any one of the words it contained having conveyed a single idea to
      his mind. Lord Glistonbury came in, with papers and parchments in his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Vivian, I am afraid you have been waiting for me&mdash;have a
      thousand pardons to ask&mdash;I really could not come any sooner&mdash;I
      wished to speak to you&mdash;Won't you sit down?&mdash;We had better sit
      down quietly&mdash;there's no sort of hurry."
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship, however, seemed to be in great agitation-of spirits; and
      Vivian was convinced that his mind must be interested in an extraordinary
      manner, because he did not, as was his usual practice, digress to fifty
      impertinent episodes before he came to the point. He only blew his nose
      sundry times; and then at once said, "I wish to speak to you, Mr. Vivian,
      about the proposal you did me the honour to make for my daughter Julia.
      Difficulties have occurred on our side&mdash;very extraordinary
      difficulties&mdash;Julia, I understand, has hinted to you, sir, the nature
      of those difficulties.&mdash;Oh, Mr. Vivian," said Lord Glistonbury,
      suddenly quitting the constrained voice in which he spoke, and giving way
      to his natural feelings, "you are a man of honour and feeling, and a
      father may trust you!&mdash;&mdash;Here's my girl&mdash;a charming girl
      she is; but knowing nothing of the world&mdash;self-willed, romantic,
      open-hearted, imprudent beyond conception; do not listen to any of the
      foolish things she says to you. You are a man of sense, you love her, and
      you are every way suited to her; it is the first wish of my heart&mdash;I
      tell you frankly&mdash;to see her your wife: then do not let her childish
      folly persuade you that her affections are engaged&mdash;don't listen to
      any such stuff. We all know what the first loves of a girl of sixteen must
      be&mdash;But it's our fault&mdash;my fault, my fault, since they will have
      it so. I care not whose fault it is; but we have had very improper people
      about her&mdash;very!&mdash;very!&mdash;But all may be well yet, if you,
      sir, will be steady, and save her&mdash;save her from herself. I would
      farther suggest&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Glistonbury was going on, probably, to have weakened by amplification
      the effect of what he had said, when Lady Julia entered the room; and,
      advancing with dignified determination of manner, said, "I have your
      commands, father, that I should see Mr. Vivian again:&mdash;I obey."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is right&mdash;that is my darling Julia; I always knew she would
      justify my high opinion of her." Lord Glistonbury attempted to draw her
      towards him fondly; but, with an unaltered manner, that seemed as if she
      suppressed strong emotion, she answered, "I do not deserve your caresses,
      father; do not oppress me with praise that I cannot merit: I wish to speak
      to Mr. Vivian without control and without witness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Glistonbury rose; and growing red and almost inarticulate with anger,
      exclaimed, "Remember, Julia! remember, Lady Julia Lidhurst! that if you
      say what you said you would say, and what I said you should not say&mdash;I&mdash;Lord
      Glistonbury, your father&mdash;I, as well as all the rest of your family,
      utterly disclaim and cast you off for ever!&mdash;You'll be a thing
      without fortune&mdash;without friends&mdash;without a name&mdash;without a
      being in the world&mdash;Lady Julia Lidhurst!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am well aware of that," replied Lady Julia, growing quite pale, yet
      without changing the determination of her countenance, or abating any
      thing from the dignity of her manner: "I am well aware, that on what I am
      about to do depends my having, or my ceasing from this moment to have,
      fortune, friends, and a father."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Glistonbury stood still for a moment&mdash;fixed his eyes upon her as
      if he would have read her soul; but, without seeking to elude his inquiry,
      her countenance seemed to offer itself to his penetration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Heaven, there is no understanding this girl!" cried his lordship. "Mr.
      Vivian, I trust her to your honour&mdash;to your knowledge of the world&mdash;to
      your good sense;&mdash;in short, sir, to your love and constancy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I, sir," said Lady Julia, turning to Vivian, after her father had
      left the room, and looking at Vivian so as to stop him short as he
      approached, and to disconcert him in the commencement of a passionate
      speech; "and I, too, sir, trust to your honour, whilst I deprecate your
      love. Imprudent as I was in the first confidence I reposed in you, and
      much as I have suffered by your rashness, I now stand determined to reveal
      to you another yet more important, yet more humiliating secret&mdash;You
      owe me no gratitude, sir!&mdash;I am compelled, by the circumstances in
      which I am placed, either to deceive or to trust you. I must either become
      your wife, and deceive you most treacherously; or I must trust you
      entirely, and tell you why it would be shameful that I should become your
      wife&mdash;shameful to me and to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To me!&mdash;Impossible!" cried Vivian, bursting into some passionate
      expressions of love and admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to me, sir; and do not make any of those rash professions, of
      which you will soon repent. You think you are speaking to the same Lady
      Julia you saw yesterday&mdash;No!&mdash;you are speaking to a very
      different person&mdash;a few hours have made a terrible change. You see
      before you, sir, one who has been, till this day, the darling and pride of
      her father; who has lived in the lap of luxury; who has been flattered,
      admired, by almost all who approached her; who had fortune, and rank, and
      fair prospects in life, and youth, and spirits, and all the pride of
      prosperity; who had, I believe, good dispositions, perhaps some talents,
      and, I may say, a generous heart; who might have been,&mdash;but that is
      all over&mdash;no matter what she might have been&mdash;she is
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'A tale for ev'ry prating she.'
</pre>
    <p>
      Fallen!&mdash;fallen! fallen under the feet of those who worshipped her!&mdash;fallen
      below the contempt of the contemptible!&mdash;Worse! worse! fallen in her
      own opinion&mdash;never to rise again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Julia's voice failed, and she was forced to pause. She sunk upon a
      seat, and hid her face&mdash;for some moments she neither saw nor heard;
      but at last, raising her head, she perceived Vivian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are in amazement, sir! and I see you pity me; but let me beg of you
      to restrain your feelings&mdash;my own are as much as I can bear. O that I
      could recall a few hours of my existence! But I have not yet been able to
      tell you what has passed. My father, my friends, wish to conceal it from
      you: but, whatever I have done, however low I have sunk, I will not
      deceive, nor be an accomplice in deceit. From my own lips you shall hear
      all. This morning at daybreak, not being able to sleep, and having some
      suspicion that Mr. Russell would leave the castle, I rose, and whilst I
      was dressing, I heard the trampling of horses in the court. I looked out
      of my window, and saw Mr. Russell's man saddling his master's horse. I
      heard Mr. Russell, a moment afterwards, order the servant to take the
      horses to the great gate on the north road, and wait for him there, as he
      intended to walk through the park. I thought these were the last words I
      should ever hear him speak.&mdash;Love took possession of me&mdash;I stole
      softly down the little staircase that leads from my turret to one of the
      back doors, and got out of the castle, as I thought, unobserved: I hurried
      on, and waited in the great oak wood, through which I knew Mr. Russell
      would pass. When I saw him coming nearer and nearer to me, I would have
      given the world to have been in my own room again&mdash;I hid myself among
      the trees&mdash;yet, when he walked on in reverie without noticing me,
      taking me probably for one of the servants, I could not bear to think that
      this was the last moment I should ever see him, and I exclaimed&mdash;I
      know not what; but I know that at the sound of my voice Mr. Russell
      started, and never can I forget the look&mdash;Spare me the rest!&mdash;No!&mdash;I
      will not spare myself&mdash;I offered my heart, my hand,&mdash;and they
      were rejected!&mdash;In my madness I told him I regarded neither wealth,
      nor rank, nor friends, nor&mdash;That I would rather live with him in
      obscurity than be the greatest princess upon earth&mdash;I said this and
      more&mdash;and I was rejected&mdash;And even at this moment, instead of
      the vindictive passions which are said to fill the soul of a woman
      scorned, I feel admiration for your noble friend: I have not done him
      justice; I cannot repeat his words, or describe his manner. He persuaded,
      by his eloquence compelled, me to return to this castle. He took from me
      all hope; he destroyed by one word all my illusions&mdash;he told me that
      he loves another. He has left me to despair, to disgrace; and yet I love,
      esteem, and admire him, above all human beings! Admire one who despises
      me!&mdash;Is it possible? I know not, but it is so&mdash;I have more to
      tell you, sir!&mdash;As I returned to the castle, I was watched by Miss
      Strictland. How she knew all that had passed, I cannot divine; perhaps it
      was by means of some spy who followed me, and whom I did not perceive: for
      I neither saw nor heard any thing but my passion. Miss Strictland
      communicated her discovery immediately to my father. I have been these
      last two hours before a family tribunal. My mother, with a coldness a
      thousand times worse than my poor father's rage, says, that I have only
      accomplished her prophecies; that she always knew and told my father that
      I should be a disgrace to my family. But no reproaches are equal to my
      own; I stand self-condemned. I feel like one awakened from a dream. A few
      words!&mdash;a single look from Mr. Russell!&mdash;how they have altered
      all my views, all my thoughts! Two hours' reflection&mdash;Two hours, did
      I say?&mdash;whole years&mdash;a whole existence&mdash;have passed to me
      in the last two hours: I am a different creature. But it is too late&mdash;too
      late!&mdash;Self-esteem is gone!&mdash;happiness is over for me in this
      world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Happiness over for you!" exclaimed Vivian in a tone expressive of the
      deep interest he felt for her; "Self-esteem gone!&mdash;No! Lady Julia; do
      not blame yourself so severely for what has passed! Blame the
      circumstances in which you have been placed; above all, blame me&mdash;blame
      my folly&mdash;my madness; your secret never would have been known, if I
      had not&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you," interrupted Lady Julia, rising from her seat; "but no
      consolation can be of any avail. It neither consoles nor justifies me that
      others have been to blame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Permit me, at least," pursued Vivian, "to speak of my own sentiments for
      one moment. Permit me to say, Lady Julia, that the confidence with which
      you have just honoured me, instead of diminishing my attachment, has so
      raised my admiration for your candour and magnanimity, that no obstacles
      shall vanquish my constancy. I will wait respectfully, and, if I can,
      patiently, till time shall have effaced from your mind these painful
      impressions; I shall neither ask nor accept of the interference or
      influence of your father, nor of any of your friends; I shall rely solely
      on the operation of your own excellent understanding, and shall hope for
      my reward from your noble heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not think it possible," said Lady Julia, looking at Vivian with
      dignified determination, "you do not think it possible, after all that has
      passed, after all that I have told you, that I could so far degrade myself
      or you, as to entertain any thoughts of becoming your wife? Farewell! Mr.
      Vivian.&mdash;&mdash;You will not see me again. I shall obtain permission
      to retire, and live with a relation in a distant part of the country;
      where I shall no more be seen or heard of. My fortune will, I hope, be of
      use to my sister.&mdash;&mdash;My poor father!&mdash;I pity him; he loves
      me: he loses his daughter for ever; worse than loses her! My mother, too&mdash;I
      pity her! for, though she does not love me, she will suffer for me; she
      will suffer more than my father, by the disgrace that would be brought
      upon my family, if ever the secret should be publicly known. My brother!&mdash;Oh,
      my beloved brother! he knows nothing yet of all this!&mdash;But why do I
      grieve you with my agony of mind? Forget that Lady Julia Lidhurst ever
      existed!&mdash;I wish you that happiness which I can never enjoy&mdash;I
      wish you may deserve and win a heart capable of feeling real love!&mdash;Adieu!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Convinced that all farther pursuit of Lady Julia Lidhurst would be vain,
      that it could tend only to increase her difficulties and his
      mortification, Vivian saw that the best thing he could possibly do was to
      leave Glistonbury. Thus he should relieve the whole family from the
      embarrassment of his presence; and, by immediate change of scene and of
      occupation, he had the best chance of recovering from his own
      disappointment. If Lady Julia was to quit the castle, he could have no
      inducement to stay; if her ladyship remained, his continuing in her
      society would be still more dangerous to his happiness. Besides, he felt
      offended with Lord Glistonbury, who evidently had wished to conceal from
      him the truth; and, without considering what was just or honourable, had
      endeavoured to secure, at all events, an establishment for his daughter,
      and a connexion for his family. To the weight of these reasons must be
      added a desire to see Mr. Russell, and to effect a reconciliation with
      him. The accumulated force of all these motives had power to overcome
      Vivian's habitual indecision: his servant was surprised by an order to
      have every thing ready for his journey to town immediately. Whilst his man
      prepared to obey, or at least to meditate upon the cause of this unusually
      decided order, our hero went in quest of Lord Glistonbury, to pay his
      compliments to his lordship previous to his departure. His lordship was in
      his daughter Julia's dressing-room, and could not be seen; but presently
      he came to Vivian in great hurry and distress of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A sad stroke upon us, Mr. Vivian!&mdash;a sad stroke upon us all&mdash;but
      most upon me; for she was the child of my expectations&mdash;I hear she
      has told you every thing&mdash;you, also, have been very ill-used&mdash;Never
      was astonishment equal to mine when I heard Miss Strictland's story. I
      need not caution you, Mr. Vivian, as to secrecy; you are a man of honour,
      and you see the peace of our whole family is at stake. The girl is going
      to a relation of ours in Devonshire.&mdash;Sha'n't stay here&mdash;sha'n't
      stay here&mdash;Disgrace to my family&mdash;She who was my pride&mdash;and,
      after all, says she will never marry.&mdash;Very well!&mdash;very well!&mdash;I
      shall never see her again, that I am determined upon.&mdash;I told her,
      that if she did not behave with common sense and propriety, in her last
      interview with you, I would give her up&mdash;and so I will, and so I do.&mdash;The
      whole is Lady Glistonbury's fault&mdash;she never managed her rightly when
      she was a child. Oh! I should put you on your guard in one particular&mdash;Miss
      Bateman knows nothing of what has happened&mdash;I wish Miss Strictland
      knew as little&mdash;I hate her. What business had she to play the spy
      upon my daughter? She does well to be a prude, for she is as ugly as sin.
      But we are in her power. She is to go to-morrow with Julia to Devonshire.
      It will make a quarrel between me and Miss Bateman&mdash;no matter for
      that; for now, the sooner we get rid of that Rosamunda, too, the better&mdash;she
      talks me dead, and will let no one talk but herself. And, between you and
      me, all this could not have happened, if she had looked after her charge
      properly.&mdash;Not but what I think Miss Strictland was still less fit to
      guide a girl of Julia's genius and disposition. All was done wrong at
      first, and I always said so to Lady Glistonbury. But, if the secret can be
      kept&mdash;and <i>that</i> depends on you, my dear friend&mdash;after six
      months' or a twelve-month's <i>rustication</i> with our poor parson in the
      country, you will see how tamed and docile the girl will come back to us.
      This is my scheme; but nobody shall know my whole mind but you&mdash;I
      shall tell her I will never see her again; and that will pacify Lady
      Glistonbury, and frighten Julia into submission. She says she'll never
      marry.&mdash;Stuff! Stuff!&mdash;You don't believe her!&mdash;What man who
      has seen any thing of the world ever believes such stuff?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian's servant came into the room to ask his master some question about
      horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going!&mdash;where? Going!&mdash;when? Going!&mdash;how?" cried Lord
      Glistonbury, as soon as the servant withdrew. "Surely, you are not going
      to leave us, Mr. Vivian?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian explained his reasons&mdash;Lord Glistonbury would not allow them
      any weight, entreated and insisted that he should stay at least a few days
      longer; for his going "just at this moment would seem quite like a break
      up in the family, and would be the most unfriendly and cruel thing
      imaginable." Why Lord Glistonbury so earnestly pressed his stay, perhaps
      even his lordship himself did not exactly know; for, with all the air of
      being a person of infinite address and depth of design, his lordship was
      in reality childishly inconsistent; what the French call <i>inconséquent</i>.
      On any subject, great or small, where he once took it into his head, or,
      as he called it, <i>made it a point</i>, that a thing should be so or so,
      he was as peremptory, or, where he could not be peremptory, as anxious, as
      if it were a matter of life and death. In his views there was no
      perspective, no keeping&mdash;all objects appeared of equal magnitude; and
      even now, when it might be conceived that his whole mind was intent upon a
      great family misfortune, he, in the course of a few minutes, became as
      eager about a mere trifle as if he had nothing else in the world to think
      of. From the earnestness with which Lord Glistonbury urged him to stay a
      few days, at least one day longer, Vivian was induced to believe that it
      must be a matter of real consequence to his lordship&mdash;"And, in his
      present state of distress, I cannot refuse such a request," thought
      Vivian. He yielded, therefore, to these solicitations, and consented to
      stay a few days longer; though he knew the prolonging his visit would be,
      in every respect, disagreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner Lord Glistonbury announced to the company that the physician had
      advised change of air immediately for Lord Lidhurst; and that, in
      consequence, his son would set out early the next morning for Devonshire&mdash;that
      his daughter Julia wished to go with her brother, and that Miss Strictland
      would accompany them. Lord Glistonbury apologized for his daughter's
      absence, "preparations for her journey so suddenly decided upon," &amp;c.
      Lady Glistonbury and Lady Sarah looked terribly grim whilst all this was
      saying; but the gravity and stiffness of their demeanour did not appear
      any thing extraordinary to the greater part of the company, who had no
      idea of what was going forward. The lawyer, the captain, and the chaplain,
      however, interchanged significant looks; and many times, during the course
      of the evening, they made attempts to draw out Vivian's thoughts, but they
      found him impenetrable. There was an underplot of a quarrel between Miss
      Strictland and Miss Bateman, to which Vivian paid little attention; nor
      was he affected, in the slightest degree, by the Rosamunda's declaration
      to Lord Glistonbury, that she must leave his family, since she found that
      Miss Strictland had a larger share than herself of his lordship's
      confidence, and was, for what reason she could not divine, to have the
      honour of accompanying Lady Julia into Devonshire. Vivian perceived these
      quarrels, and heard the frivolous conversation of the company at
      Glistonbury Castle without interest, and with a sort of astonishment at
      the small motives by which others were agitated, whilst his whole soul was
      engrossed by love and pity for Lady Julia. In vain he hoped for another
      opportunity of seeing and speaking to her. She never appeared. The next
      morning he rose at daybreak that he might have the chance of seeing her:
      he begged Miss Strictland to entreat her ladyship would allow him to say a
      few words before she set out; but Miss Strictland replied, that she was
      assured the request would be vain; and he thought he perceived that Miss
      Strictland, though she affected to lament Lady Julia's blindness to her
      own interests and contumacy, in opposing her father's wishes, was, in
      reality, glad that she persisted in her own determination. Lord Lidhurst,
      on account of the weak state of his health, was kept in ignorance of every
      thing that could agitate him; and, when Vivian took leave of him, the poor
      young man left many messages of kindness and gratitude for Mr. Russell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry that he was obliged to leave me; for, ill or well, there is no
      human being, I will not except any one but my sister Julia, whom I should
      so much wish to have with me. Tell him so; and tell him&mdash;be sure you
      remember my very words, for perhaps I shall never see him again&mdash;tell
      him, that, living or dying, I shall feel grateful to him. He has given me
      tastes and principles very different from those I had when he came into
      this house. Even in sickness, I feel almost every hour the advantage of my
      present love for literature. If I should live and recover, I hope I shall
      do him some credit; and I trust my family will join in my gratitude.
      Julia, my dear sister! why do you weep so bitterly?&mdash;If I had seen
      you come into the room, I would not have spoken of my health."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Glistonbury came up to tell them that Miss Strictland was ready. "Mr.
      Vivian," cried his lordship, "will you hand Julia into the carriage?&mdash;Julia,
      Mr. Vivian is offering you his services."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian, as he attended Lady Julia, had so much respect for her feelings,
      that, though he had been waiting with extreme impatience for an
      opportunity <i>to say a few words</i>, yet now he would not speak, but
      handed her along the gallery, down the staircase, and across the great
      hall, in profound silence. She seemed sensible of this forbearance; and,
      turning to him at a moment when they could not be overheard, said, "It was
      not from unkindness, Mr. Vivian, I refused to see you again, but to
      convince you that my mind is determined&mdash;if you have any thing to
      say, I am ready to hear it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there nothing to be hoped from time?" said Vivian. "Your father, I
      know, has hopes that&mdash;&mdash;All I ask is, that you will not make any
      rash resolutions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I make none; but I tell <i>you</i>, for your own sake, not to cherish any
      vain hope. My father does not know my mind sufficiently, therefore he may
      deceive you; but I will not.&mdash;&mdash;I thought, after the manner in
      which I spoke to you yesterday, you would have had too much strength of
      mind to have rendered this repetition of my sentiments necessary.&mdash;&mdash;Attach
      yourself elsewhere as soon as you can.&mdash;I sincerely wish your
      happiness. Miss Strictland is waiting.&mdash;Farewell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurried forward to the carriage; and, when she was gone, Vivian
      repented that he had seen her again, as it had only given them both
      additional and fruitless pain.

      What passed during some succeeding days at Glistonbury Castle he scarcely
      knew; no trace remained in his mind of anything but the confused noise of
      people, who had been talking, laughing, and diverting themselves in a
      manner that seemed to him incomprehensible. He exerted himself, however,
      so far as to write to Russell, to implore his forgiveness, and to solicit
      a return of his friendship, which, in his present state of unhappiness,
      was more necessary to him than ever. When he had finished and despatched
      this letter, he sunk again into a sort of reckless state, without hope or
      determination, as to his future life. He could not decide whether he
      should go to his mother immediately on leaving Glistonbury, or to Mr.
      Russell, or (which he knew was the best course he could pursue) attend his
      duty in parliament, and, by plunging at once into public business, change
      the course of his thoughts, and force his mind to resume its energy. After
      altering his determination twenty times, after giving at least a dozen
      contradictory orders about his journey, his servant at last had his
      ultimatum, <i>for London</i>&mdash;the carriage to be at the door at ten
      o'clock the next morning. Every thing was ready at the appointed hour.
      Breakfast over, Vivian waited only to pay his compliments to Lady
      Glistonbury, who had breakfasted in her own apartment. Lady Sarah, with a
      manner as formal as usual, rose from the breakfast-table, and said she
      would let her mother know that Mr. Vivian was going. Vivian waited half an
      hour&mdash;an hour&mdash;two hours. Lady Glistonbury did not appear, nor
      did Lady Sarah return. The company had dispersed after the first
      half-hour. Lord Glistonbury began to believe that the ladies did not mean
      to make their appearance. At length a message came from Lady Glistonbury.&mdash;"Lady
      Glistonbury's compliments to Mr. Vivian&mdash;her ladyship was concerned
      that it was out of her power to have the pleasure of seeing Mr. Vivian, as
      she was too much indisposed to leave her room.&mdash;She and Lady Sarah
      wished him a very good journey."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian went up to his room for his gloves, which he missed at the moment
      when he was going. Whilst he was opening the empty drawers one after
      another, in search of his gloves, and, at the same time, calling his
      servant to find them, he heard a loud scream from an adjoining apartment.
      He listened again&mdash;all was silent; and he supposed that what he had
      heard was not a scream: but, at that moment, Lady Sarah's maid flung open
      his door, and, running in with out-stretched arms, threw herself at
      Vivian's feet. Her sobs and tears prevented his understanding one syllable
      she said. At last she articulated intelligibly, "Oh, sir!&mdash;don't be
      so cruel to go&mdash;my lady!&mdash;my poor lady! If you go, it will kill
      Lady Sarah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kill Lady Sarah?&mdash;Why I saw her in perfect health this morning at
      breakfast!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, dear sir! you know nothing of the matter!" said the maid, rising,
      and shutting the door: "you don't know what a way she has been in ever
      since the talk of your going&mdash;fits upon fits every night, and my
      lady, her mother, and I up holding her&mdash;and none in the house knowing
      it but ourselves. Very well at breakfast! Lord help us! sir. How little
      you know of what she has suffered! Lord have mercy upon me! I would not be
      a lady to be so much in love, and left so, for any thing in the whole
      world. And my Lady Sarah keeps every thing so to herself;&mdash;if it was
      not for these fits they would never have knowed she cared no more for you
      than a stone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, probably you are quite mistaken," said Vivian; "and that I have
      nothing to do with the young lady's illness. If she has fits, I am very
      sorry for it; but I can't possibly&mdash;&mdash;Certainly, you are quite
      mistaken!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord, sir!&mdash;mistaken! As if I could be mistaken, when I know my lady
      as well as I know myself! Why, sir, I know from the time of the election,
      when you was given to her by all the country&mdash;and to be sure when we
      all thought it would be a match directly&mdash;and the Lord knows what put
      it off!&mdash;I say, from that time, her heart was set upon you. Though
      she never said a word to me, or any one, I knew how it was, through all
      her coldness&mdash;And to be sure, when you was in Lon'on so much with us,
      all the town said, as all the country did afore, that to be sure it was to
      be a match&mdash;But then that sad affair, with that artfullest of women,
      that took you off from all that was good, and away, the Lord knows where,
      to foreign parts!&mdash;Well! to be sure, I never shall forget the day you
      come back again to us!&mdash;and the night of the ball!&mdash;and you
      dancing with my lady, and all so happy; then, to be sure, all were sarten
      it was to be immediately&mdash;&mdash;And now to go and break my poor
      lady's heart at the last&mdash;Oh, sir, sir! if you could but see her, it
      would touch a heart of marble!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian's astonishment and dismay were so great, that he suffered the girl,
      who was an unpractised creature, to go on speaking without interruption:
      the warmth of affection with which she spoke of her lady, also, surprised
      him: for, till this instant, he had no idea that any one could love Lady
      Sarah Lidhurst; and the accounts she gave of the lady's sufferings not
      only touched his compassion, but worked upon his vanity. "This cold, proud
      young lady that never loved none before, to think," as her maid said,
      "that she should come to such a pass, as to be in fits about him. And it
      was her belief that Lady Sarah never would recover it, if he went away out
      of the castle this day."
    </p>
    <p>
      The ringing of a bell had repeatedly been heard, whilst Lady Sarah's maid
      was speaking; it now rang violently, and her name was called vehemently
      from the adjoining apartment. "I must go, I <i>must</i> go!&mdash;Oh, sir!
      one day, for mercy's sake! stay one day longer!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian, though he had been moved by this girl's representations, was
      determined to effect his retreat whilst it was yet in his power; therefore
      he ran down stairs, and had gained the hall, where he was shaking hands
      with Lord Glistonbury, when my Lady Glistonbury's own woman came in a
      great hurry to say, that her lady, finding herself a little better now,
      and able to see Mr. Vivian, begged he would be so good as to walk up to
      her dressing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian, with a heavy heart and slow steps, obeyed; there was no refusing,
      no evading such a request. He summoned all his resolution, at the same
      time saying to himself, as he followed his conductor along the gallery,
      "It is impossible that I can ever be drawn in to marry Lady Sarah.&mdash;This
      is a concerted plan, and I shall not be so weak as to be the dupe of so
      gross an artifice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Glistonbury's maid showed him into her lady's dressing-room and
      retired. Lady Glistonbury was seated, and, without speaking, pointed to a
      chair which was set opposite to her. "So! a preparation for a scene,"
      thought Vivian. He bowed, but, still keeping his hat in his hand, did not
      sit down:&mdash;he was extremely happy to hear, that her ladyship found
      herself something better&mdash;much honoured by her permitting him to pay
      his respects, and to offer his grateful acknowledgments to her ladyship
      before his departure from Glistonbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship, still without speaking, pointed to the chair. Vivian sat
      down, and looked as if he had "screwed his courage to the sticking place."
      Lady Glistonbury had sometimes a little nervous trembling of her head,
      which was the only symptom of internal agitation that was ever observable
      in her; it was now increased to a degree which Vivian had never before
      seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you in haste, sir, to be gone?" said Lady Glistonbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not if her ladyship had any commands for him; but otherwise, he had
      intended, if possible, to reach town that night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not delay you many minutes, Mr. Vivian," said her ladyship. "You
      need not be under apprehension that Lady Glistonbury should seek to detain
      you longer than your own inclinations induce you to stay; it is,
      therefore, unnecessary to insult her with any appearance of haste or
      impatience."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian instantly laid down his hat, and protested that he was not in the
      slightest degree impatient: he should be very ungrateful, as well as very
      ill-bred, if, after the most hospitable manner in which he had been
      received and entertained at Glistonbury Castle, he could be in haste to
      quit it. He was entirely at her ladyship's orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Glistonbury bowed formally&mdash;was again silent&mdash;the trembling
      of her head very great&mdash;the rest of her form motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have sent for you, Mr. Vivian," said she, "that I might, before you
      leave this castle, set you right on a subject which much concerns me. From
      the representations of a foolish country girl, a maid-servant of my
      daughter, Lady Sarah Lidhurst, which I have just discovered she has made
      to you, I had reason to fear that you might leave Glistonbury with very
      false notions&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      A cry was heard at this moment from the inner apartment, which made Vivian
      start; but Lady Glistonbury, without noticing it, went on speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With notions very injurious to my daughter Sarah; who, if I know any
      thing of her, would rather, if it were so ordained, go out of this world,
      than condescend to any thing unbecoming her sex, her education, and her
      family."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian, struck with respect and compassion for the mother, who spoke to
      him in this manner, was now convinced that there had been no concerted
      plan to work upon his mind, that the maid had spoken without the knowledge
      of her lady; and the more proudly solicitous Lady Glistonbury showed
      herself to remove what she called the false impression from his mind, the
      more he was persuaded that the girl had spoken the truth. He was much
      embarrassed between his good-nature and his dread of becoming a sacrifice
      to his humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied in general terms to Lady Glistonbury, that he had the highest
      respect for Lady Sarah Lidhurst, and that no opinion injurious to her
      could be entertained by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Respect she must command from all," said Lady Glistonbury; "<i>that</i>
      it is out of any man's power to refuse her: as to the rest, she leaves
      you, and I leave you, sir, to your own conscience."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Glistonbury rose, and so did Vivian. He hoped that neither her
      ladyship nor Lady Sarah had any cause&mdash;&mdash;He hesitated; the
      words, <i>to reproach, to complain, to be displeased</i>, all came to his
      lips; but each seemed improper; and, none other being at hand to convey
      his meaning, he could not finish his sentence: so he began another upon a
      new construction, with "I should be much concerned if, in addition to all
      my other causes of regret in leaving Glistonbury Castle, I felt that I had
      incurred Lady Glistonbury's or Lady Sarah's displea&mdash;disapprobation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to that, sir," said Lady Glistonbury, "I cannot but have my own
      opinion of your conduct; and you can scarcely expect, I apprehend, that a
      mother, such as I am, should not feel some disapprobation of conduct,
      which has&mdash;&mdash;Sir, I beg I may not detain you&mdash;I have the
      honour to wish you a good journey and much happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      An attendant came from an inner apartment with a message! from Lady Sarah,
      who was worse, and wished to see her mother&mdash;"Immediately!&mdash;tell
      her, immediately!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant returned with the answer. Vivian was retiring, but he came
      back, for he saw at that moment a convulsive motion contract Lady
      Glistonbury's face: she made an effort to walk; but if Vivian had not
      supported her instantly, she must have fallen. She endeavoured to
      disengage herself from his assistance, and again attempted to walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For God's sake, lean upon me, madam!" said Vivian, much alarmed. With his
      assistance, she reached the door of the inner room: summoning all the
      returning powers of life, she then withdrew her arm from his, and pointing
      back to the door at which Vivian entered, she said, "That is your way,
      sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me&mdash;I cannot go&mdash;I cannot leave you at this moment,"
      said Vivian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is my daughter's apartment, sir," said Lady Glistonbury, stopping,
      and standing still and fixed. Some of the attendants within, hearing her
      ladyship's voice, opened the door; Lady Glistonbury made an effort to
      prevent it, but in vain: the chamber was darkened, but as the door opened,
      the wind from an open window blew back the curtain, and some light fell
      upon a canopy bed, where Lady Sarah lay motionless, her eyes closed, and
      pale as death; one attendant chafing her temples, another rubbing her
      feet: she looked up just after the door opened, and, raising her head, she
      saw Vivian&mdash;a gleam of joy illumined her countenance, and coloured
      her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," repeated Lady Glistonbury, "this is my daughter's&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She could articulate no more. She fell across the threshold, struck with
      palsy. Her daughter sprang from the bed, and, with Vivian's assistance,
      raised and carried Lady Glistonbury to an arm-chair near the open window,
      drew back the curtain, begged Vivian to go to her father, and instantly to
      despatch a messenger for medical assistance. Vivian sent his own servant,
      who had his horse ready at the door, and he bid the man go as fast as he
      could.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you don't leave Glistonbury to-day, sir?" said the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do as I order you&mdash;Where's Lord Glistonbury?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship, with the newspapers and letters open in his hand, came up&mdash;but
      they dropped on hearing the intelligence that Vivian communicated. His
      lordship was naturally humane and good-natured; and the shock was greater,
      perhaps, to him, from the sort of enmity in which he lived with Lady
      Glistonbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dread to go up stairs," said he. "For God's sake, Vivian, don't leave
      me in this distress!&mdash;do order your carriage away!&mdash;&mdash;Put
      up Mr. Vivian's carriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Sarah's maid came to tell them that Lady Glistonbury had recovered
      her speech, and that she had asked, "if Mr. Vivian was gone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do come up with me," cried Lord Glistonbury, "and she will see you are
      not gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's my lord and Mr. Vivian, my lady," said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning to Lady Glistonbury's woman, she added, in a loud whisper,
      "Mr. Vivian won't go to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Sarah gave her maid some commission, which took her out of the room.
      Lady Sarah, no longer the formal, cold, slow personage whom Vivian
      detested, now seemed to him, and not only seemed but was, quite a
      different being, inspired with energy, and quickness, and presence of
      mind: she forgot herself, and her illness, and her prudery, and her love,
      and every other consideration, in the sense of her mother's danger. Lady
      Glistonbury had but imperfectly recovered her recollection. At one moment
      she smiled on Vivian, and tried to stretch out her hand to him, as she saw
      him standing beside Lady Sarah. But when he approached Lady Glistonbury,
      and spoke to her, she seemed to have some painful recollection, and,
      looking round the room, expressed surprise and uneasiness at his being
      there. Vivian retired; and Lord Glistonbury, who was crying like a child,
      followed, saying, "Take me out with you&mdash;Dr. G&mdash;&mdash; ought to
      be here before now&mdash;I'll send for another physician!&mdash;Very
      shocking&mdash;very shocking&mdash;at Lady Glistonbury's time of life, too&mdash;for
      she is not an old woman by any means. Lady Glistonbury is eighteen months
      younger than I am!&mdash;Nobody knows how soon it may be their turn!&mdash;It's
      very shocking!&mdash;If I had known she was ill, I would have had advice
      for her sooner. She is very patient&mdash;too patient&mdash;a great deal
      too patient. She never will complain&mdash;never tells what she feels,
      body or mind&mdash;at least never tells <i>me</i>; but that may be my
      fault in some measure. Should be very sorry Lady Glistonbury went out of
      the world with things as they are now between us. Hope to God she will get
      over this attack!&mdash;Hey! Mr. Vivian?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian said whatever he could to fortify this hope, and was glad to see
      Lord Glistonbury show feelings of this sort. The physician arrived, and
      confirmed these hopes by his favourable prognostics. In the course of the
      day and night her face, which had been contracted, resumed its natural
      appearance; she recovered the use of her arm: a certain difficulty of
      articulation, and thickness of speech, with what the physician called
      hallucination of mind, and a general feebleness of body, were all the
      apparent consequences of this stroke. She was not herself sensible of the
      nature of the attack, or clear in her ideas of any thing that had passed
      immediately previous to it. She had only an imperfect recollection of her
      daughter's illness, and of some hurry about Mr. Vivian's going away. She
      was, however, well enough to go into her dressing-room, where Vivian went
      to pay his respects to her, with Lord Glistonbury. By unremitting
      exertions, and unusual cheerfulness, Lady Sarah succeeded in quieting her
      mother's confused apprehensions on her account. When out of Lady
      Glistonbury's hearing, all the attendants and the physicians repeatedly
      expressed fear that Lady Sarah would over-fatigue and injure herself by
      this extraordinary energy; but her powers of body and mind seemed to rise
      with the necessity for exertion; and, on this great occasion, she suddenly
      discovered a warmth and strength of character, of which few had ever
      before discerned even the slightest symptoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who would have expected this from Sarah?" whispered Lord Glistonbury to
      Vivian. "Why, her sister did not do more for me when I was ill! I always
      knew she loved her mother, but I thought it was in a quiet, commonplace
      way&mdash;Who knows but she loves me too?&mdash;or might&mdash;" She came
      into the room at this moment&mdash;"Sarah, my dear," said his lordship,
      "where are my letters and yesterday's papers, which I never read?&mdash;I'll
      see if there be any thing in them that can interest your mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Glistonbury opened the papers, and the first article of public news
      was, "a dissolution of parliament confidently expected to take place
      immediately." This must put an end to Vivian's scheme of going to town to
      attend his duty in parliament. "But, may be, it is only newspaper
      information." It was confirmed by all Lord Glistonbury and Vivian's
      private letters. A letter from his mother, which Vivian now for the first
      moment had time to peruse, mentioned the dissolution of parliament as
      certain; she named her authority, which could not be doubted; and, in
      consequence, she had sent down supplies of wine for an election; and she
      said that she would "be immediately at Castle Vivian, to keep open house
      and open heart for her son. Though not furnished," she observed, "the
      castle would suit the better all the purposes of an election; and she
      should not feel any inconvenience, for her own part, let the
      accommodations be what they might."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Glistonbury directly proposed and insisted upon Lady Mary Vivian's
      making Glistonbury her head-quarters. Vivian objected: Lady Glistonbury's
      illness was an ostensible and, he hoped, would be a sufficient excuse for
      declining the invitation. But Lord Glistonbury persisted: "Lady
      Glistonbury, he was sure, would wish it&mdash;nothing would be more
      agreeable to her." His lordship's looks appealed to Lady Sarah, but Lady
      Sarah was silent; and, when her father positively required her opinion, by
      adding, "Hey! Sarah?" she rather discouraged than pressed the invitation.
      She said, that though she was persuaded her mother would, if she were
      well, be happy to have the pleasure of seeing Lady Mary Vivian; yet she
      could not, in her mother's present situation, venture to decide how far
      her health might be able to stand any election bustle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Sarah said this with a very calm voice, but blushed extremely as she
      spoke; and, for the first time, Vivian thought her not absolutely plain;
      and, for the first time, he thought even the formality and deliberate
      coolness of her manner were not disagreeable. He liked her more, at this
      moment, than he had ever imagined it possible he could like Lady Sarah
      Lidhurst; but he liked her chiefly because she did not press him into her
      service, but rather forwarded his earnest wish to get away from
      Glistonbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Glistonbury appealed to the physician, and asked whether company and
      amusement were not "the best things possible for his patient? Lady
      Glistonbury should not be left alone, surely! Her mind should be
      interested and amused; and an election would be a fortunate circumstance
      just at present!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician qualified the assent which his lordship's peremptory tone
      seemed to demand, by saying, "that certainly moderate amusement, and
      whatever interested without agitating her ladyship, would be salutary."
      His lordship then declared that he would leave it to Lady Glistonbury
      herself to decide: quitting the end of the room where they were holding
      their consultation, he approached her ladyship to explain the matter. But
      Lady Sarah stopped him, beseeching so earnestly that no appeal might be
      made to her mother, that Vivian was quite moved; and he settled the
      business at once to general satisfaction, by declaring that, though
      neither he nor Lady Mary Vivian could think of intruding as inmates at
      present, yet that they should, as soon as Lady Glistonbury's health would
      permit, be as much at Glistonbury Castle as possible; and that the short
      distance from his house would make it, he hoped, not inconvenient to his
      lordship for all election business. Lord Glistonbury acceded, and Lady
      Sarah appeared gratefully satisfied. His lordship, who always took the
      task of explanation upon himself, now read the paragraph about the
      dissolution aloud to Lady Glistonbury; informed her, that Lady Mary Vivian
      was coming immediately to the country; and that they should hope to see
      Lady Mary and Mr. Vivian almost every day, though he could not prevail
      upon them to take up their abode during the election at Glistonbury. Lady
      Glistonbury listened, and tried, and seemed to understand&mdash;bowed to
      Mr. Vivian and smiled, and said she remembered he was often at Glistonbury
      during the last election&mdash;that she was happy to hear she should have
      the pleasure to see Lady Mary Vivian&mdash;that some people disliked <i>election
      times</i>, but for her part she did not, when she was strong. Indeed, the
      last election she recollected with particular pleasure&mdash;she was happy
      that Lord Glistonbury's interest was of service to Mr. Vivian. Then "she
      hoped his canvass <i>to-day</i> had been successful?"&mdash;and asked some
      questions that showed her mind had become confused, and that she was
      confounding the past with the present. Lady Sarah and Mr. Vivian said a
      few words to set her right&mdash;she looked first at one, and then at the
      other, listening, and then said&mdash;"I understand&mdash;God bless you
      both." Vivian took up his hat, and looked out of the window, to see if his
      carriage was at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Vivian wishes you a good morning, madam," said Lady Sarah: "he is
      going to Castle Vivian, to get things ready for Lady Mary's arrival."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you health and happiness, sir," said Lady Glistonbury, attempting
      to rise, whilst some painful reminiscence altered her countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray do not stir, don't disturb yourself, Lady Glistonbury. I shall pay
      my respects to your ladyship again as soon as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And pray bring me good news of the election, and how the poll stands
      to-morrow, Mr. Vivian," added her ladyship, as he left the room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Vivian, who had felt oppressed and almost enslaved by his compassion,
      breathed more freely when he at last found himself in his carriage,
      driving away from Glistonbury. His own castle, and the preparations for
      his mother's arrival, and for the expected canvass, occupied him so much
      for the ensuing days, that he had scarcely time to think of Lady Julia or
      of Lady Sarah, of Russell or Selina: he could neither reflect on the past,
      nor anticipate the future; the present, the vulgar present, full of
      upholsterers, and paper-hangers, and butlers, and grooms, and tenants, and
      freeholders, and parasites, pressed upon his attention with importunate
      claims. The dissolution of parliament took place. Lady Mary Vivian arrived
      almost as soon as the newspaper that brought this intelligence: with her
      came a new set of thoughts, all centering in the notion of her son's
      consequence in the world, and of his happiness&mdash;ideas which were too
      firmly associated in her mind ever to be separated. She said that she had
      regretted his having made such a long stay in the country during the last
      session, because he had missed opportunities of distinguishing himself
      farther in parliament. The preceding session her ladyship had received
      gratifying compliments on her son's talents, and on the figure he had <i>already</i>
      made in public life; she felt her self-love as well as her affection
      interested in his continuing his political career with spirit and success.
      "As to the present election," she observed, "there could be little doubt
      that he would be re-elected with the assistance of the Glistonbury
      interest; and," added her ladyship, smiling significantly, "I fancy your
      interest is pretty strong in that quarter. The world has given you by
      turns to Lady Julia and Lady Sarah Lidhurst; and I am asked continually
      which of the Lady Lidhursts you are in love with. One of these ladies
      certainly must be my daughter-in-law; pray, if you know, empower me to say
      which." Lady Mary Vivian spoke but half in earnest, till the extraordinary
      commotion her words created in her son, convinced her that the report had
      not, now at least, been mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Next to Miss Selina Sidney," continued Lady Mary, "who, after her
      positive and long persisted-in refusal, is quite out of the question, I
      have, my dear son, always wished to see you married to one of the Lady
      Lidhursts; and, of course, Lady Julia's talents, and beauty, and youth&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian interrupted and hastily told his mother that Lady Julia Lidhurst
      was as much out of the question as Miss Sidney could be; for that he had
      offered himself, and had been refused; and that he had every reason to
      believe that the determination of his second mistress against him would be
      at least as absolute and unconquerable as that of his first. His mother
      was in amazement. That her son could be refused by Lady Julia Lidhurst
      appeared a moral and political impossibility, especially when the desire
      for a connexion between the families had been so obvious on the side of
      the Glistonburys. What could be the meaning of this? Lady Julia was
      perhaps under an error, and fancied he was some way engaged to Miss
      Sidney; "or, perhaps," said Lady Mary, who had a ready wit for the
      invention of delicate distresses, "perhaps there is some difficulty about
      the eldest sister, Lady Sarah; for you know the first winter you were
      given to her.&mdash;Ay, that must be the case. I will go to Glistonbury
      to-morrow, and I will have Lady Julia to myself for five minutes: I think
      I have some penetration, and I will know the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary was again surprised, by hearing from her son that Lady Julia was
      not at Glistonbury&mdash;that she was gone with her brother into
      Devonshire. So there was a dead silence for some minutes, succeeded by an
      exclamation from Lady Mary, "There is some grand secret here&mdash;I must
      know it!" Her ladyship forthwith commenced a close and able
      cross-examination, which Vivian stopped at last by declaring that he was
      not at liberty to speak upon the subject: he knew, he said, that his
      mother was of too honourable and generous a temper to press him farther.
      His mother was perfectly honourable, but at the same time extremely
      curious; and though she continually repeated, "I will not ask you another
      question&mdash;I would not upon any account lead you to say a syllable
      that could betray any confidence reposed in you, my dear son;" yet she
      indulged herself in a variety of ingenious conjectures: "I know it is so;"
      or, "I am sure that I have guessed now, but I don't ask you to tell me.&mdash;You
      do right to deny it."&mdash;Amongst the variety of her conjectures, Lady
      Mary did not find out the truth; she was prepossessed by the idea that
      Russell was attached to Selina Sidney&mdash;a secret which her own
      penetration had discovered whilst her son was abroad with Mrs. Wharton,
      and which she thought no mortal living knew but herself. Pre-occupied with
      this notion, Russell was now omitted in all her combinations. His having
      quitted Glistonbury did not create any suspicion of the real cause of his
      sudden departure, because there was a sufficient reason for his going to
      the north to see his sick relation; and Lady Mary was too good a
      philosopher to assign two causes for the same event, when she had found
      one that was adequate to the production of the effect. She therefore
      quietly settled it in her imagination, that Lady Julia Lidhurst was going
      to be married immediately to a certain young nobleman, who had been lately
      at Glistonbury whilst they were acting plays. The next day she went with
      Vivian to Glistonbury Castle; for, waiving all the ceremonials of
      visiting, she was anxious to see poor Lady Glistonbury, of whose illness
      she had been apprised, in general terms, by her son. An impulse of
      curiosity, mixed perhaps with motives of regard for her good friend Lady
      Glistonbury, hastened this visit. They found Lady Glistonbury much better;
      she looked nearly as well as she had done before this stroke; and she had
      now recovered her memory, and the full use of her understanding. Vivian
      observed, that she and Lady Sarah were both convinced, by Lady Mary
      Vivian's curiosity, that he had given no hint of any thing which they did
      not wish to be known: and the pleasurable consciousness of his integrity
      disposed him to be pleased with them. Lord Glistonbury, on his side, was
      convinced that Vivian had behaved honourably with respect to his daughter
      Julia; so all parties were well satisfied with each other. His lordship
      answered Lady Mary Vivian's inquiries after his son and his daughter Julia
      by saying, that Miss Strictland had just returned to Glistonbury with
      rather more favourable accounts of Lord Lidhurst's health, and that Julia
      and he were now at his brother the Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;'s. Between
      this brother and my Lord Glistonbury there had never been any great
      intimacy, their characters and their politics being very different. The
      moment Lady Mary Vivian heard Lord Glistonbury pronounce, with such
      unusual cordiality, the words, "my brother the bishop," she recollected
      that the bishop had a very amiable, accomplished, and remarkably handsome
      son; so she arranged directly in her imagination that this was the person
      to whom Lady Julia was engaged. Being now thoroughly convinced that this
      last conjecture was just, she thought no more about Lady Julia's affairs;
      but turned her attention to Lady Sarah, whose cold and guarded manners,
      however, resisted her utmost penetration. Disappointed in all her attempts
      to lead to sentiment or love, the conversation at last ran wholly upon the
      approaching election, upon the canvass, and the strength of the various
      interests of the county; on all which subjects Lady Sarah showed
      surprisingly exact information. Presently Lord Glistonbury took Vivian
      with him to his study to examine some poll-book, and then put into his
      hands a letter from Lady Julia Lidhurst, which had been enclosed in one to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told you that I intended to <i>rusticate</i> Julia," said his lordship,
      "with a poor parson and his wife&mdash;relations, distant relations of
      ours in Devonshire; but this plan has been defeated by my foolish good
      brother the bishop. On their journey they passed close by his palace; I
      charged Miss Strictland to be incog.; but they stayed to rest in the town,
      for Lidhurst was fatigued; and some of the bishop's people found them out,
      and the bishop sent for them, and at last came himself. He was so sorry
      for Lidhurst's illness, and, as Miss Strictland says, so much charmed with
      Julia, whom he had not seen since she was a child, that he absolutely took
      possession of them; and Julia has made her party good with him, for he
      writes me word he cannot part with her; that I must allow her to remain
      with him; and that they will take all possible care of Lyndhurst's health.
      I believe I must yield this point to the bishop; for altogether it looks
      better that Julia should be at the palace than at the parsonage; and,
      though my poor brother has not the knowledge of the world one could wish,
      or that is necessary to bring this romantic girl back to reason, yet&mdash;But
      I keep you from reading your letter, and I see you are impatient&mdash;Hey?&mdash;very
      natural!&mdash;but, I am afraid, all in vain&mdash;I'll leave you in
      peace. At any rate," added Lord Glistonbury, "you know I have always stood
      your firm friend in this business; and you know I'm discreet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian never felt so grateful for any instance of his lordship's
      friendship and discretion as for that which he gave at this moment, by
      quitting the room, and leaving him in peace to read his letter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Before you open this letter, you will have heard, probably, that my
      uncle, the Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;, has taken me under his protection. I
      cannot sufficiently regret that I was not a few years, a few months,
      sooner, blessed with such a Mentor. I never, till now, knew how much power
      kindness has to touch the mind in the moment of distress; nor did I ever,
      till now, feel how deeply the eloquence of true piety sinks into the
      heart. This excellent friend will, I hope, in time restore me to my better
      self. From the abstraction, the selfishness of passion, I think I am
      already somewhat recovered. After being wholly absorbed by one sentiment,
      I begin to feel again the influence of other motives, and to waken to the
      returning sense of social duty. Among the first objects to which, in
      recovering from this trance, or this fever of the soul, I have power to
      turn my attention, your happiness, sir, next to that of my own nearest
      relations, I find interests me most. After giving you this assurance, I
      trust you will believe that, to insure the felicity, or even to restore
      the health and preserve the life of any relation or friend I have upon
      earth, I should not think myself justified in attempting to influence your
      mind to any thing which I did not sincerely and firmly believe would be
      for your permanent advantage as well as for theirs. Under the solemn faith
      of this declaration, I hope that you will listen to me with patience and
      confidence. From all that I have myself seen, and from all that I have
      heard of your character, I am convinced that your wife should be a woman
      of a disposition precisely opposite, in many respects, to mine. Your
      character is liable to vary, according to the situations in which you are
      placed; and is subject to sudden but transient impressions from external
      circumstances. You have hitherto had a friend who has regulated the
      fluctuations of your passions; now that he is separated from you, how much
      will you feel the loss of his cool and steady judgment! Should you not,
      therefore, in that bosom friend, a wife, look for a certain firmness and
      stability of character, capable of resisting, rather than disposed to
      yield, to sudden impulse; a character, not of enthusiasm, but of duty; a
      mind, which, instead of increasing, by example and sympathy, any defects
      of your own&mdash;pardon the expression&mdash;should correct or compensate
      these by opposite qualities? And supposing that, with such sobriety and
      strength of character as I have described, there should be connected a
      certain slowness, formality, and coldness of manner, which might not at
      first be attractive to a man of your vivacity, let not this repel you:
      when once you have learned to consider this manner as the concomitant and
      indication of qualities essential to your happiness, it would, I am
      persuaded, become agreeable to you; especially as, on nearer observation,
      you would soon discover that, beneath that external coldness, under all
      that snow and ice, there is an accumulated and concentrated warmth of
      affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of this, sir, you must lately have seen an example in my own family. At
      the moment when my poor mother was struck with palsy, you saw my sister's
      energy; and her character, probably, then appeared to you in a new point
      of view. From this burst of latent affection for a parent, you may form
      some idea what the power of the passion of love would be in her soul; some
      idea, I say; for I am persuaded that none but those who know her as well
      as I do can form an adequate notion of the strength of attachment of which
      she is capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be surprised, perhaps, sir, to hear me reason so coolly for
      others on a subject where I have acted so rashly for myself; and you may
      feel no inclination to listen to the advice of one who has shown so little
      prudence in her own affairs: therefore, having stated my reasons, and
      suggested my conclusions, I leave you to apply them as you think proper;
      and I shall only add, that the accomplishment of my wishes, on this
      subject, would give me peculiar satisfaction. It would relieve my mind
      from part of a weight of self-reproach. I have made both my parents
      unhappy. I have reason to fear that the shock my mother received, by my
      means, contributed much to her late illness. An event that would restore
      my whole family to happiness must, therefore, be to me the most desirable
      upon earth. I should feel immediate relief and delight, even in the hope
      of contributing to it by any influence I can have over your mind. And,
      independently of the pleasure and pride I should feel in securing my
      sister's happiness and yours, I should enjoy true satisfaction, sir, in
      that intimate friendship with you, which only the ties of such near
      relationship could permit or justify. You will accept of this assurance,
      instead of the trite and insulting, because unmeaning or unsafe, offer of
      friendship, which ladies sometimes make to those who have been their
      lovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "JULIA LIDHURST.
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;&mdash; Palace:"
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first reading of this letter, Vivian felt nothing but a renewal of
      regret for having lost all chance of obtaining the affections of the
      person by whom it was written: on a second perusal, he was moved by the
      earnest expression of her wishes for his happiness; and the desire to
      gratify her, on a point on which she was so anxious, influenced him much
      more than any of her arguments. Whatever good sense the letter contained
      was lost upon him; but all the sentiment operated with full force, yet not
      with sufficient power to conquer the repugnance he still felt to Lady
      Sarah's person and manners. Lord Glistonbury made no inquiries concerning
      the contents of his daughter Julia's letter; but, as far as politeness
      would permit, he examined Vivian's countenance when he returned to the
      drawing-room. Lady Glistonbury's manner was as calm as usual; but the
      slight shake of her head was a sufficient indication of her internal
      feelings. Lady Sarah looked pale, but so perfectly composed, that Vivian
      was convinced she, at least, knew nothing of her sister's letter. So great
      indeed was the outward composure, and so immoveable was Lady Sarah, that
      it provoked Lady Mary past endurance; and as they drove home in the
      evening, she exclaimed, "I never saw such a young woman as Lady Sarah
      Lidhurst! She is a stick, a stone, a statue&mdash;she has completely
      satisfied my mind on one point. I own that when I found Lady Julia was out
      of the question, I did begin to think and wish that Lady Sarah might be my
      daughter-in-law, because she has really been so carefully brought up, and
      the connexion with the Glistonbury family is so desirable: then I had a
      notion, before I saw her this morning, that the girl liked you, and might
      be really capable of attachment; but now, indeed, I am convinced of the
      folly of that notion. She has no feeling&mdash;none upon earth&mdash;scarcely
      common sense! She thinks of nothing but how she holds her elbows. The
      formality and importance with which she went on cutting off ends of
      worsted from that frightful tapestry work, whilst I talked of you, quite
      put me out of all manner of patience. She has no feeling&mdash;none upon
      earth!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, ma'am," said Vivian, "you do her injustice: she certainly has feeling&mdash;for
      her mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, for her mother, may be! a kind of mechanical affection!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, ma'am, if you had seen her at the time that her mother was struck
      with palsy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Much to his own surprise, Vivian found himself engaged in a defence, and
      almost in an eulogium upon Lady Sarah; but the injustice of his mother's
      attack, on this point, was, he knew, so great, that he could not join in
      Lady Mary's invective.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, my dear Charles!" said she, "do you recollect, on this very road, as
      we were returning from Glistonbury Castle, this time two years, you called
      Lady Sarah a petrifaction?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, ma'am; because I did not know her then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, I must have time to analyze her more carefully, and I
      suppose I shall discover, as you have done, that she is not a
      petrifaction. So, then, Lady Sarah really is to be the woman after all. I
      am content, but I absolutely cannot pretend to like her&mdash;I like the
      connexion, however; and the rest is your affair.&mdash;You haven't
      proposed yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless me! no, ma'am! God forbid! How fast your imagination goes, my dear
      mother!&mdash;Is there no difference between saying, that a woman is not a
      petrifaction, and being in love with her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In love! I never said a word about being in love&mdash;I know that's
      impossible&mdash;I asked only if you had proposed for her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear ma'am, no!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary expressed her satisfaction; and, perhaps, the injustice with
      which she continued, for some days, to asperse Lady Sarah Lidhurst, as
      being unfeeling, served her more, in Vivian's opinion, than any other mode
      in which she could have spoken of her ladyship. Still he felt glad that he
      had not <i>yet proposed</i>. He had not courage either to recede or
      advance; circumstances went on, and carried him along with them, without
      bringing him to any decision. The business of the election proceeded;
      every day Lord Glistonbury was with him, or he was at Glistonbury Castle;
      every hour he saw more plainly the expectations that were formed:
      sometimes he felt that he was inevitably doomed to fulfil these, and at
      other times he cherished the hope that Lady Julia would soon return home,
      and that, by some fortunate revolution, she might yet be his. He had not
      now the advantage of Russell's firmness to support him in this emergency.
      Russell's answer to his letter was so coolly determined, and he so
      absolutely declined interfering farther in his affairs, that Vivian saw no
      hopes of regaining his friendship, or of benefiting by his counsels. Thus
      was Vivian in all the helplessness and all the horrors of indecision, when
      an event took place, which materially changed the face of affairs in the
      Glistonbury family. Just at the time when the accounts of his health were
      the most favourable, and when his friends were deceived by the most
      sanguine hopes of his recovery, Lord Lidhurst died. His mother was the
      only person in the family who was prepared for this catastrophe: they
      dreaded to communicate the intelligence to her, lest it should bring on
      another attack of her dreadful malady; but to their astonishment, she
      heard it with calm resignation,&mdash;said she had long foreseen this
      calamity, and that she submitted to the will of Heaven. After pity for the
      parents who lost this amiable and promising young man, heir to this large
      fortune and to this splendid title, people began to consider what change
      would be made in the condition of the rest of the family. The Lady
      Lidhursts, from <i>being very small fortunes</i>, became heiresses to a
      large estate. The earldom of Glistonbury was to devolve to a nephew of
      Lord Glistonbury, in case the Lady Lidhursts should not marry, or should
      not have heirs male; but, in case they should marry, the title was to go
      to the first son. All these circumstances were of course soon known and
      talked of in the neighbourhood; and many congratulated Vivian upon the
      great accession of fortune, and upon the high expectations of the lady to
      whom they supposed him engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first visit which Vivian and his mother paid after the death of
      Lord Lidhurst at Glistonbury Castle, they found there a young man very
      handsome, but of a dark, reserved countenance, whose physiognomy and
      manner immediately prepossessed them against him; on his part, he seemed
      to eye them with suspicion, and to be particularly uneasy whenever Vivian
      either mentioned the election or approached Lady Sarah. This young man was
      Mr. Lidhurst, Lord Glistonbury's nephew and heir-at-law. It was obvious,
      almost at first sight, that the uncle disliked the nephew; but it was not
      so easy to perceive that the nephew despised the uncle. Mr. Lidhurst,
      though young, was an excellent politician; and his feelings were always
      regulated by his interests. He had more abilities than Lord Glistonbury,
      less vanity, but infinitely more ambition. In Lord Glistonbury, ambition
      was rather affected, as an air suited to his rank, and proper to increase
      his consequence: Mr. Lidhurst's was an earnest, inordinate ambition, yet
      it was cold, silent, and calculating; his pride preyed upon him inwardly,
      but it never hurried him into saying or doing an extravagant thing. Those
      who were not actuated solely by ambition, he always looked upon as fools,
      and those who were, he considered, in general, as knaves: the one he
      marked as dupes, the other as rivals. He had been at the Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;'s,
      during Lord Lidhurst's illness, and at the time of his death. Ever since
      Lady Julia's arrival at the bishop's, he had foreseen the probability of
      this event, and had, in consequence of the long-sightedness of his views,
      endeavoured to make himself agreeable to her. He found this impossible;
      but was, however, easily consoled by hearing that she had resolved never
      to marry; he only hoped that she would keep her resolution; and he was now
      at Glistonbury Castle, in the determination to propose for his other
      cousin, Lady Sarah, who would, perhaps, equally well secure to him his
      objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! my dear Vivian," said Lord Glistonbury, drawing him aside, "how
      d'ye relish my nephew, Marmaduke Lidhurst? Need not be afraid to speak the
      truth, for I tell you at once that he is no particular favourite here; not
      <i>en bonne odeur</i>; but that's only between you and me. He thinks that
      I don't know that he considers me as a shallow fellow, because I haven't
      my head crammed with a parcel of statistical tables, all the fiscal and
      financiering stuff which he has at his calculating fingers' ends; but I
      trust that I am almost as good a politician as he is, and I'm free to
      believe, have rather more knowledge of the world&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'In men, not books, experienced was my lord'&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      Hey? Hey, Vivian? and can see through him with half an eye, I can tell
      him.&mdash;Wants to get Lady Sarah&mdash;Yes, yes; but never came near us
      till we lost my poor boy&mdash;he won't win Lady Sarah either, or I'm much
      mistaken. Did you observe how jealous he was of you?&mdash;Right!&mdash;right!&mdash;he
      has penetration!&mdash;Stay, stay! you don't know Marmaduke yet&mdash;don't
      know half his schemes. How his brow clouded when we were talking of the
      election! I must hint to you, he has been sounding me upon that matter; he
      has a great mind to stand for this county&mdash;talks of starting at the
      first day of the poll. I told him it could not do, as I was engaged to
      you. He answered, that of course was only a conditional promise, in case
      none of my own relations stood. I fought shy, and he pressed confoundedly.&mdash;Gad!
      he would put me in a very awkward predicament, if he was really to stand!
      for you know what the world would say, if they saw me opposing my own
      nephew, a rising young man, and not for a relation either; and Marmaduke
      Lidhurst is just your deep fellow to plan such a thing and execute it, not
      caring at what or whose expense. I can tell him, however, I am not a man
      to be bullied out of my interest, or to be outwitted either.&mdash;Stand
      firm, Vivian, my good friend, and I'll stand by you; depend on me!&mdash;I
      only wish&mdash;&mdash;" Here his lordship paused. "But I cannot say more
      to you now; for here is my precious heir-at-law coming to break up the
      confederacy. I'll ride over and see you to-morrow;&mdash;now, let us all
      be mute before Marmaduke, our master politician, as becomes us&mdash;Hey!
      Vivian? Hey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding this sort of jealousy of Marmaduke, and the bravadoing
      style in which Lord Glistonbury spoke of him, he spoke to him in a very
      different manner: it was apparent to Vivian that his lordship was under
      some awe of his nephew, and that, whilst he cherished this secret dislike,
      he dreaded coming to any open rupture with a man who was, as his lordship
      apprehended, so well able to make his own party good in the world. When
      Marmaduke did emerge from that depth of thought in which he generally
      seemed to be sunk, and when he did condescend to converse, or rather to
      speak, his theme was always of persons in power, or his sarcasms against
      those who never would obtain it; from any one thing he asserted, it could
      never be proved, but, from all he said, it might be inferred, that he
      valued human qualities and talents merely as they could, or could not,
      obtain a price in the political market. The power of speaking in public,
      as it is a means in England of acquiring all other species of power, he
      deemed the first of Heaven's gifts; and successful parliamentary speakers
      were the only persons of whom he expressed admiration. As Vivian had
      spoken, and had been listened to in the House of Commons, he was in this
      respect an object of Marmaduke Lidhurst's envy; but this envy was
      mitigated by contempt for our hero's want of perseverance in ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is that Mr. Vivian of yours," said he to his uncle, whilst Vivian
      was gone to talk to the ladies&mdash;"you'll find he will be but a woman's
      man, after all!&mdash;Heavens! with his fluency in public, what I would
      have done by this time of day! This poor fellow has no consistency of
      ambition&mdash;no great views&mdash;no reach of mind. Put him in for a
      borough, and he would be just as well content as if he carried the county.
      You'll see he will, after another session or two, cut out, and retire
      without a pension, and settle down into a mere honest country gentleman.
      He would be no connexion to increase the consequence of your family. Lady
      Sarah Lidhurst would be quite lost with such a nobody! Her ladyship, I am
      convinced, has too much discrimination, and values herself too highly, to
      make such a <i>missy</i> match."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Glistonbury coughed, and cleared his throat, and blew his nose, and
      seemed to suffer extremely, but chiefly under the repression of his usual
      loquacity. Nothing could be at once a greater proof of his respect for his
      nephew's abilities, and of his lordship's dislike to him, than this
      unnatural silence. Mr. Lidhurst's compliments on Lady Sarah's
      discrimination seemed, however, to be premature, and unmerited; for,
      during the course of this day, she treated all the vast efforts of her
      cousin Marmaduke's gallantry with haughty neglect, and showed, what she
      had never before suffered to be visible in her manner, a marked preference
      for Mr. Vivian's conversation. The sort of emulation which Mr. Lidhurst's
      rivalship produced increased the value of the object; she, for whom there
      was a contention, immediately became a prize. Vivian was both provoked and
      amused by the alternate contempt and jealousy which Mr. Lidhurst betrayed;
      this gentleman's desire to keep him out of the Glistonbury family, and to
      supplant him in Lady Sarah's favour, piqued him to prove his influence,
      and determined him to maintain his ground. Insensibly, Vivian's attentions
      to the lady became more vivacious; and he was vain of showing the ease,
      taste, and elegance of his gallantry; and he was flattered by the idea,
      that all the spectators perceived both its superiority and its success.
      Lady Sarah, whose manners had much improved since the departure of Miss
      Strictland, was so much embellished by our hero's attentions, that he
      thought her quite charming. He had been prepared to expect fire under the
      ice, but he was agreeably surprised by this sudden spring of flowers from
      beneath the snow. The carriage was at the door in the evening, and had
      waited half an hour, before he was aware that it was time to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right, my dear son!" Lady Mary began, the r moment they were
      seated in the carriage; "you are quite right, and I was quite wrong, about
      Lady Sarah Lidhurst: she has feeling, indeed&mdash;strong, generous
      feeling&mdash;and she shows it at the proper time: a fine, decided
      character! Her manners, to-day, so easy, and her countenance so animated,
      really she looked quite handsome, and I think her a charming woman.&mdash;What
      changes love can make!&mdash;Well, now I am satisfied: this is what I
      always wished&mdash;connexion, family, fortune, every thing; and the very
      sort of character you require in a wife,&mdash;the very person, of all
      others, that is suited to you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she were but a little more like her sister&mdash;or Selina Sidney <i>even!</i>"
      said Vivian, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That very word <i>even</i>&mdash;your saying like Selina Sidney <i>even</i>&mdash;shows
      that you have not much cause for sighing: for you see how quickly the mere
      fancy in these matters changes&mdash;and you may love Lady Sarah
      presently, as much as you loved <i>even</i> Lady Julia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible! ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible! Why, my dear Charles, you astonish me! for you cannot but see
      the views and expectations of all the family, and of the young lady
      herself; and your attentions to-day were such as could bear but one
      construction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were they, ma'am? I was not aware of that at the time&mdash;that is, I
      did not mean to engage myself&mdash;Good Heavens! surely I am not engaged?&mdash;You
      know a man is not bound, like a woman, by a few foolish words; compliments
      and gallantry are not such serious things with us men. Men never consider
      themselves engaged to a woman till they make an absolute proposal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that is a common maxim with young men of the present day, but I
      consider it as dishonourable and base; and very sorry should I be to see
      it adopted by my son!" cried Lady Mary indignantly. "Ask your friend Mr.
      Russell's opinion on this point: he long ago told you&mdash;I know he did&mdash;that
      if you had not serious thoughts of Lady Sarah Lidhurst, you would do very
      wrong, after all the reports that have gone abroad, to continue your
      intimacy with the Glistonburys, and thus to deceive her and her whole
      family&mdash;I only appeal to Mr. Russell;&mdash;will you ask your friend
      Russell's opinion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian sighed again deeply for the loss of his friend Russell; but as he
      could not, without touching upon Lady Julia's affairs, explain the cause
      of the coolness between him and his friend, he answered only, "that an
      appeal to Mr. Russell was unnecessary when he had his mother's opinion."
      Lady Mary's wish for the Glistonbury <i>connexion</i> fortified her
      morality at this moment, and she replied, "Then my decided opinion is,
      that it would be an immoral and dishonourable action to break such a tacit
      engagement as this, which you have voluntarily contracted, and which you
      absolutely could not break without destroying the peace and happiness of a
      whole family. Even that cold Lady Glistonbury grew quite warm to-day; and
      you must see the cause.&mdash;And in Lady Glistonbury's state of health,
      who could answer for the consequences of any disappointment about her
      favourite daughter, just after the loss of her son, too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more, mother, for Heaven's sake! I see it all&mdash;I feel it all&mdash;I
      must marry Lady Sarah, then.&mdash;By what fatality am I doomed, am I
      forced to marry a woman whom I cannot love, whose person and manners are
      peculiarly disagreeable to me, and when I'm half in love with another
      woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would be a shocking thing, indeed," said Lady Mary, retracting, and
      alarmed; for now another train of associations was wakened, and she judged
      not by her worldly, but by her romantic system.&mdash;"I am sure I would
      not, upon any account, urge you to act against your feelings. I would not
      be responsible for such a marriage, if you are really in love with her
      sister, and if Lady Sarah's person and manners are peculiarly and
      absolutely disagreeable to you. I should do a very wicked action&mdash;should
      destroy my son's happiness and morals, perhaps, by insisting on such a
      marriage&mdash;Heaven forbid!" (A silence of a mile and a half long
      ensued.) "But, Charles, after all I saw to-day, how can I believe that
      Lady Sarah is so disagreeable to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ma'am, she happened not to be absolutely disagreeable to me to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! well! then she may not happen to be disagreeable to you to-morrow, or
      the next day, or ever again!&mdash;And, as to the fancy for her sister,
      when all hope is over, you know love soon dies of itself."
    </p>
    <p>
      So ended the conversation.&mdash;The next morning, at an unusual hour,
      Lord Glistonbury made his appearance at Castle Vivian, with an air of
      great vexation and embarrassment: he endeavoured to speak of trivial
      topics; but, one after another, these subjects dropped. Then Lady Mary,
      who saw that he was anxious to speak to her son, soon took occasion to
      withdraw, not without feeling some curiosity, and forming many
      conjectures, as to the object his lordship might have in view in this
      conference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Glistonbury's countenance exhibited, in quick alternation, a look of
      absolute determination and of utter indecision. At length, with abrupt
      effort, he said, "Vivian, have you seen the papers to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The newspapers?&mdash;yes!&mdash;no!&mdash;They are on the table&mdash;I
      did not look at them&mdash;Is there any thing extraordinary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, faith!&mdash;extraordinary, very extraordinary!&mdash;But it is not
      here&mdash;it is not there&mdash;this is not the right paper&mdash;it is
      not in your paper. That's extraordinary, too"&mdash;(then feeling in both
      pockets)&mdash;"I was a fool not to bring it with me&mdash;May be I have
      it&mdash;Yes, here it is!&mdash;Not public news, but private."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian was all expectation, for he imagined that something about Lady
      Julia was coming. Lord Glistonbury, who, in his commerce with public men,
      had learned the art of paying in words, to gain time when in danger of a
      bankruptcy of ideas, went on, stringing sentences together, without much
      meaning, whilst he was collecting his thoughts and studying the
      countenance of his auditor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You recollect my suggestions the last time I had the honour of speaking
      to you on a particular subject. I confess, Mr. Lidhurst's conduct does not
      meet my ideas of propriety; but other persons are free to form what
      judgment they think fit upon the occasion. I shall submit the matter to
      you, Mr. Vivian, feeling myself called upon to come forward immediately to
      explain it to your satisfaction; and I do not fear to commit myself, by
      stating at once my sentiments, and the light in which it strikes me; for
      there must be some decision shown, somehow or other, and on some side or
      other.&mdash;&mdash;Decision is all in all in public business, as the
      great Bacon or somebody says&mdash;and nobody knows that better than
      Marmaduke."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here his lordship grew warm, and quitting his parliamentary cant, assumed
      his familiar style.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gad! he has stolen a march upon us&mdash;out-generalled us&mdash;but, in
      my private opinion, not in the handsomest style possible&mdash;Hey,
      Vivian?&mdash;Hey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear lord, I have not heard the fact yet," said Vivian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! the fact is simply&mdash;Look here, he has without my encouragement
      or concurrence&mdash;and, indeed, as he very well knew, contrary to my
      approbation and wishes&mdash;gone, and declared himself candidate for this
      county; and here's his fine flourishing, patriotic, damned advertisement
      in the paper&mdash;'To the gentlemen, clergy, and freeholders of the
      county.'&mdash;&mdash;Gad! how it startled me this morning! When I first
      saw it I rubbed my eyes, and could hardly believe it was Marmaduke. Though
      I pique myself on knowing a man's style at the first line, yet I could not
      have believed it was his, unless I had seen his name at full length in
      these great abominable characters&mdash;'John Marmaduke Lidhurst.'&mdash;'Glastonbury
      Castle!' too&mdash;as if I had countenanced the thing, or had promised my
      support; when he knew, that but yesterday I was arguing the point with him
      in my study, and told him I was engaged to you. Such an ungentlemanlike
      trick!&mdash;for you know it reduces me to the dilemma of supporting a man
      who is only my friend, against my nearest relation by blood, which, of
      course, would have an odd and awkward appearance in the eyes of the
      world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian expressed much concern for his lordship's difficulties; but
      observed that the world would be very unjust if it blamed him, and he was
      sure his lordship had too much decision of character.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, independently of the world," interrupted his lordship, "even in our
      own family, amongst all the Lidhursts and their remotest connexions, there
      would be quite a league formed against me; and these family quarrels are
      ugly affairs; for though our feudal times are done away, party clanships
      have succeeded to feudal clanships; and we chiefs of parties must keep our
      followers in good humour, or we are nothing in the <i>field</i>&mdash;I
      should say <i>in the house</i>&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;&mdash;I laugh, but
      it is a very serious business; for Marmaduke Lidhurst would be, in private
      or public, an impracticable enemy. Marmaduke's a fellow capable of
      inextinguishable hatred; and he is everywhere, and knows every body, of
      all the clubs, a rising young man, who is listened to, and who would make
      his story credited. And then, with one's nephew, one can't settle these
      things in <i>an honourable way</i>&mdash;these family quarrels must be
      arranged amicably, not honourably; and that's the difficulty: the laws of
      honour are dead letters in these cases, and the laws of the land do not
      reach these niceties of feeling.&mdash;&mdash;But of the most important
      fact you are still to be apprised."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" cried Vivian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you have not yet heard Marmaduke's master-stroke of policy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!&mdash;What is it, my lord?&mdash;I am all attention&mdash;pray
      explain it to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there's the delicacy&mdash;there's the difficulty!&mdash;No, no, no.&mdash;Upon
      my soul, I cannot name it!" cried Lord Glistonbury. "It revolts my
      feelings&mdash;all my feelings&mdash;as a man, as a gentleman, as a
      father. Upon my honour, as a peer, I would speak if I could; but, for the
      soul of me, I cannot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know, my dear lord," said Vivian, "there can be no delicacies or
      difficulties with me; your lordship has done me the honour to live always
      on such a footing of intimacy with me, that surely there is not any thing
      you cannot say to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, that's true," said Lord Glistonbury, quitting his affected air of
      distress, and endeavouring to throw off his real feeling of embarrassment:
      "you are right, my dear Vivian! we are certainly upon terms of such
      intimacy, that I ought not to be so scrupulous. But there are certain
      things, a well-born, well-bred man&mdash;in short, it would look so like&mdash;But,
      in fact, I am driven to the wall, and I must defend myself as well as I
      can against this nephew of mine&mdash;I know it will look like the most
      horrible thing upon earth, like what I would rather be decapitated than do&mdash;I
      know it will look, absolutely, as if I came here to ask you to marry my
      daughter,&mdash;which, you know, is a thing no gentleman could have the
      most remotely in his contemplation; but, since I am so pressed, I must
      tell you the exact truth, and explain to you, however difficult,
      Marmaduke's master-stroke&mdash;&mdash;he has proposed for Lady Sarah; and
      has had the assurance to ask me whether there is or is not any truth in
      certain reports which he is pleased to affirm have gone abroad&mdash;Heaven
      knows how or why!&mdash;&mdash;And he urges me&mdash;the deep dog! for his
      cousin's sake, to contradict those reports, in the only effectual manner,
      by a temporary cessation of the intimate intercourse between Castle Vivian
      and Glistonbury Castle, whilst Lady Sarah remains unmarried; or, if our
      master politician would speak plainly, till he has married her himself.&mdash;&mdash;At
      any rate, I have spoken frankly, Vivian, hey? you'll allow; and I am
      entitled both to a candid interpretation of my motives, and to equal
      frankness of reply."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst his lordship had been speaking, compassion, gratitude, vanity,
      rivalship, honour, Lady Mary Vivian's conversation, Lady Julia's letter,
      then again the <i>connexion</i>, the earldom in future, the present
      triumph or disappointment about the election, the insolent intrusion of
      Mr. Lidhurst, the cruelty of abandoning a lady who was in love with him,
      the dishonour, the impossibility of receding after <i>certain reports</i>;
      all these ideas, in rapid succession, pressed on Vivian's mind: and his
      decision was in consequence of the feelings and of the embarrassment of
      the moment. His reply to Lord Glistonbury was a proposal for Lady Sarah,
      followed by as many gallant protestations as his presence of mind could
      furnish. He did not very well know what he said, nor did Lord Glistonbury
      scrupulously examine whether he had the air and accent of a true lover,
      nor did his lordship inquire what had become of Vivian's late love for
      Lady Julia; but, quite content that the object should be altered, the
      desire the same, he relieved Vivian by exclaiming, "Come, come, all this
      sort of thing Lady Sarah herself must hear; and I've a notion&mdash;but I
      can keep a secret. You'll return with me directly to Glistonbury. Lady
      Glistonbury will be delighted to see you; and I shall be delighted to see
      Marmaduke's face, when I tell him you have actually proposed for Sarah&mdash;for
      now I must tell you all. Our politician calculated upon the probability
      that you would not decide, you see, to make a proposal at once, that would
      justify me to the world in supporting my son-in-law against my nephew. As
      to the choice of the son-in-law, Sarah settles that part of the business
      herself, you know; for, when two proposals are made, both almost equally
      advantageous, in the common acceptation of the word, I am too good a
      father not to leave the decision to my daughter. So you see we understand
      one another perfectly, and will make Marmaduke, too, understand us
      perfectly, contrary to his calculations, hey, hey?&mdash;&mdash;Mr.
      Politician, your advertisement must be withdrawn, I opine, in the next
      paper&mdash;hey, Vivian? my dear Vivian!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With similar loquacity, Lord Glistonbury continued, in the fulness of his
      heart, all the way they went together to Glistonbury Castle; which was
      agreeable to Vivian, at least by saving him from all necessity of
      speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So!" said Vivian to himself, "the die is cast, and I have actually
      proposed for Lady Sarah Lidhurst!&mdash;Who would have expected this two
      years ago?&mdash;I would not have believed it, if it had been foretold to
      me even two months ago. But it is a very&mdash;a very suitable match, and
      it will please the friends of both parties; and Lady Sarah is certainly
      very estimable, and capable of very strong attachment; and I like her,
      that is, I liked her yesterday very much&mdash;I really like her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon those mixed motives, between convenience and affection, from which,
      Dr. Johnson says, most people marry, our hero commenced his courtship of
      the Lady Sarah Lidhurst. As the minds of both parties on the subject are
      pretty well known to our readers, it would be cruel to fatigue them with a
      protracted description of the formalities of courtship. It is sufficient
      to say, that my Lord Glistonbury had the satisfaction of seeing his nephew
      disappointed.

      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "And the marriage was solemnized with much pomp and magnificence, and
      every demonstration of joy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Novelists and novel readers are usually satisfied when they arrive at this
      happy catastrophe; their interest and curiosity seldom go any farther:
      but, in real life, marriage is but the beginning of domestic happiness or
      misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the celebration of Vivian's nuptials, an event happened which
      interrupted all the festivities at Glistonbury, and which changed the
      bridal pomp to mourning. Lady Glistonbury, who had been much fatigued by
      the multitude of wedding-visits she was obliged to receive and return, had
      another stroke of the palsy, which, in a few hours, terminated fatally.
      Thus, the very event which Vivian had dreaded, as the probable consequence
      of his refusal to marry her daughter, was, in fact, accelerated by the
      full accomplishment of her wishes. After the loss of her mother, Lady
      Sarah Vivian's whole soul seemed to be engrossed by fondness for her
      husband. In public, and to all eyes but Vivian's, her ladyship seemed much
      the same person as formerly: but, in private, the affection she expressed
      for him was so great, that he frequently asked himself whether this could
      be the same woman, who, to the rest of the world, and in every other part
      of her life, appeared so cold and inanimate. On a very few occasions her
      character, before her marriage, had, "when much enforced, given out a
      hasty spark, and straight was cold again;" but now she permitted the
      steady flame to burn without restraint. Duty and passion had now the same
      object. Before marriage, her attachment had been suppressed, even at the
      hazard of her life; she had no idea that the private demonstrations of
      unbounded love from a married woman to her husband could be either
      blameable or dangerous: she believed it to be her duty to love her husband
      as much as she possibly could.&mdash;Was not he her husband? She had been
      taught that she should neither read, speak, nor think of love; and she had
      been so far too much restricted on this subject, that, absolutely ignorant
      and unconscious even of her danger, she now pursued her own course without
      chart or compass. Her injudicious tenderness soon imposed such restraint
      upon her husband, as scarcely any lover, much less any husband, could have
      patiently endured. She would hardly ever suffer him to leave her. Whenever
      he went out of the house, she exacted from him a promise that he would <i>be
      back again</i> at a certain hour; and if he were even a few minutes later
      than his appointment, he had to sustain her fond reproaches. Even though
      he stayed at home all day, she was uneasy if he quitted the room where she
      sat; and he, who by this time understood, through all her exterior
      calmness, the symptoms of her internal agitation, saw by her countenance
      that she was wretched if he seemed interested in the conversation of any
      other person, especially of any other woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day when Vivian, after spending the morning <i>tête-à-tête</i> with
      Lady Sarah, signified to her his intention of dining abroad, she repeated
      her fond request that he would be sure to come home early, and that he
      would tell her at what o'clock exactly she might expect to see him again.
      He named an hour at hazard, to free himself from her importunate anxiety;
      but he could not help saying, "Pshaw!" as he ran down stairs; an
      exclamation which fortunately reached only the ears of a groom, who was
      thinking of nothing but the tops of his own boots. Vivian happened to meet
      some agreeable people where he dined: he was much pressed to stay to
      supper; he yielded to entreaty, but he had the good-natured attention to
      send home his servant, to beg that Lady Sarah and his mother would not sit
      up for him. When he returned, he found all the family in bed except Lady
      Sarah, who was sitting up waiting for him, with her watch in her hand. The
      moment he appeared, she assailed him with tender reproaches, to which he
      answered, "But why would you sit up when I begged you would not, my dear
      Lady Sarah?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied by a continuity of fond reproach; and among other things she
      said, but without believing it to be true, "Ah! I am sure you would have
      been happier if you had married my sister Julia, or <i>that</i> Miss
      Sidney!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian sighed deeply; but the next instant, conscious that he had sighed,
      and afraid of giving his wife pain, he endeavoured to turn the course of
      her thoughts to some other subject. In vain. Poor Lady Sarah said no more,
      but felt this exquisitely, and with permanent anguish. Thus her imprudence
      reverted upon herself, and she suffered in proportion to her pride and to
      her fondness. By such slight circumstances is the human heart alienated
      from love! Struggling to be free, the restive little deity ruffles and
      impairs his plumage, and seldom recovers a disposition to tranquillity.
      Vivian's good-nature had induced him for some time to submit to restraint;
      but if, instead of weakly yielding to the fond importunity of his wife&mdash;if,
      instead of tolerating the insipidity of her conversation and the
      narrowness of her views, he had with real energy employed her capacity
      upon suitable objects, he might have made her attachment the solace of his
      life. Whoever possesses the heart of a woman, who has common powers of
      intellect, may improve her understanding in twelve months more than could
      all the masters, and lectures, and courses of philosophy, and abridgments,
      and <i>documenting</i> in the universe. But Vivian had not sufficient
      resolution for such an undertaking: he thought only of avoiding to give or
      to feel present pain; and the consequences were, that the evils he dreaded
      every day increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian's mother saw the progress of conjugal discontent with anguish and
      remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" said she to herself, "I was much to blame for pressing this match.
      My son told me he could never love Lady Sarah Lidhurst. It would have been
      better far to have broken off a marriage at the church-door than to have
      forced the completion of such an ill-assorted union. My poor son married
      chiefly from a principle of honour; his duty and respect for my opinion
      had also great weight in his decision; and I have sacrificed his happiness
      to my desire that he should make what the world calls a splendid alliance.
      I am the cause of all his misery; and Heaven only knows where all this
      will end!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In her paroxysm of self-reproach, and her eagerness to <i>set things to
      rights</i> between her daughter-in-law and her son, she only made matters
      worse. She spoke with all the warmth and frankness of her own character to
      Lady Sarah, beseeching her to speak with equal openness, and to explain
      the cause of the <i>alteration</i> in Vivian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know what you mean, madam, by alteration in Mr. Vivian!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is not there some disagreement between you, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no disagreement whatever, madam, as far as I know, between Mr.
      Vivian and me&mdash;we agree perfectly," said Lady Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the <i>misunderstanding</i>!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know of any <i>misunderstanding</i>, madam. Mr. Vivian and I
      understand one another perfectly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The <i>coolness</i>, then&mdash;Oh! what word shall I use!&mdash;Surely,
      my dear Lady Sarah, there is some <i>coolness</i>&mdash;something wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure, madam, I do not complain of any coolness on Mr. Vivian's part.
      Am I to understand that he complains to your ladyship of any thing wrong
      on mine? If he does, I shall think it my duty, when he points out the
      particulars, to make any alteration he may desire in my conduct and
      manners."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Complain!&mdash;My son!&mdash;He makes no <i>complaints</i>, my dear. You
      misunderstand me. My son does not complain that any thing is wrong on your
      part."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, madam, if no complaints are made on either side, all is as it
      should be, I presume, at present; and if in future I should fail in any
      point of duty, I shall hold myself obliged to your ladyship if you will
      then act as my monitor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopeless of penetrating Lady Sarah's sevenfold fence of pride, the mother
      flew to her son, to try what could be done with his open and generous
      mind. He expressed a most earnest and sincere wish to make his wife happy.
      Conscious that he had given her exquisite pain, he endeavoured to make
      atonement by the sacrifices which he thought would be most grateful to
      her. He refrained often from company and conversation that was agreeable
      to him, and would resign himself for hours to her society. It was
      fortunate for Lady Julia Lidhurst that, by continuing with her good uncle
      the bishop, she did not see the consequences of the union which she had so
      strenuously advised. The advice of friends is often highly useful to
      prevent an imprudent match; but it seldom happens that marriages turn out
      happily which have been made from the opinion of others rather than from
      the judgment and inclinations of the parties concerned; for, let the
      general reasons on which the advice is grounded be ever so sensible, it is
      scarcely possible that the adviser can take in all the little
      circumstances of taste and temper, upon which so much of the happiness or
      misery of domestic life depends. Besides, people are much more apt to
      repent of having been guided by the judgment of another than of having
      followed their own; and this is most likely to be the case with the
      weakest minds. Strong minds can decide for themselves, not by the opinions
      but by the reasons that are laid before them: weak minds are influenced
      merely by opinions; and never, either before or after their decision, are
      firm in abiding by the preponderating reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      No letters, no intelligence from home, except a malicious hint now and
      then from her cousin Marmaduke, which she did not credit, gave her reason
      to suspect that the pair whom she had contributed to unite were not
      perfectly happy. So Lady Julia exulted in the success of her past
      counsels, and indulged her generous romantic disposition in schemes for
      forwarding a union between Russell and Selina, determining to divide her
      fortune amongst the children of her friends. She concluded one of her
      letters to Lady Sarah Vivian about this time with these words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could I but see <i>one other person</i>,&mdash;whom I must not name,
      rewarded for his virtues, as you are, by happy love, I should die content,
      and would write on my tomb:&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
      Far removed from all romance and all generosity of sentiment, Lord
      Glistonbury, in the mean time, went on very comfortably, without observing
      any thing that passed in his family. Whatever uneasiness obtruded upon his
      attention he attributed to one cause, anxiety relative to the question on
      which his present thoughts were exclusively fixed, viz. whether Lady
      Sarah's first child would be a boy or a girl. "Heaven grant a boy!" said
      his lordship; "for then, you know, there's an end of Marmaduke as
      heir-at-law!" Whenever his lordship saw a cloud on the brows of Lady Mary,
      of Lady Sarah, or of Vivian, he had one infallible charm for dispelling
      melancholy;&mdash;he stepped up close to the patient, and whispered, "It
      will be a boy!&mdash;My life upon it, it will be a boy!" Sometimes it
      happened that this universal remedy, applied at random, made the patient
      start or smile; and then his lordship never failed to add, with a nod of
      great sagacity, "Ah! you didn't know I knew what you were thinking of!&mdash;Well!
      well! you'll see we shall cut out Marmaduke yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this hope of cutting out Marmaduke, Lord Glistonbury went on very
      happily, and every day grew fonder of the son-in-law, who was the enemy of
      his heir-at-law, or whom he considered as such. The easiness of Vivian's
      temper was peculiarly agreeable to his lordship, who enjoyed the daily
      pleasure of governing a man of talents which were far superior to his own.
      This easiness of temper in our hero was much increased by the want of
      motive and stimulus. He thought that he had now lost his chance of
      happiness; he cared little for the more or less pain of each succeeding
      day; and so passive was his listlessness, that to a superficial observer,
      like Lord Glistonbury, it looked like the good-nature of perfect content.&mdash;Poor
      Vivian!&mdash;In this wreck of his happiness, one saving chance, however,
      yet remained. He had still a public character; he was conscious of, having
      preserved unblemished integrity as a member of the senate; and this
      integrity, still more than his oratorical talents, raised him far above
      most of his competitors, and preserved him not only in the opinion of
      others, but in his own. When parliament met, he went to town, took a very
      handsome house for Lady Sarah, determining to do all he could to oblige
      and please the wife whom he could not love. Lady Sarah had complete power,
      at home and abroad, of her time and her expenses: her dress, her
      equipages, her servants, her whole establishment, were above Vivian's
      fortune, and equal to her ladyship's birth and rank. She was mistress of
      every thing but of his heart. The less he liked her, the more he
      endeavoured to compensate for this involuntary fault, by allowing her that
      absolute dominion, and that external splendour, which he thought would
      gratify, and perhaps fill her mind. As for himself, he took refuge in the
      House of Commons. There he forgot for a time domestic uneasiness, and was
      truly animated by what so many affect&mdash;zeal for the good of his
      country. He was proud to recollect, that the profligate Wharton had failed
      in the attempt to laugh him out of his public virtue; he was proud that
      Wharton's prophecies of his apostasy had never been accomplished; that, as
      a public! character at least, he had fulfilled the promise of his early
      youth, and was still worthy of himself, and of that friend whom he had
      lost. He clung to this idea, as to the only hope left him in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, in a debate on some question of importance, he made an
      excellent speech, which was particularly well received by the house,
      because it came from one who had an unblemished character. When Vivian
      went into the coffee-room to refresh himself, after he had done speaking,
      several of his acquaintance crowded round him, complimenting him upon his
      success&mdash;he broke from them all! for he saw, advancing towards him
      with a smile of approbation, the friend on whose approbation he set a
      higher value than he did even on the applauses of the house&mdash;the
      friend whose lost affection he had so long and so bitterly regretted.
      Russell stretched out his hand&mdash;Vivian eagerly seized it; and, before
      they had either of them spoken one word, they both understood each other
      perfectly, and their reconciliation was completely effected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Russell, as they walked out arm in arm together, "yes, it is
      fit that I should forget all private resentment, in the pride and pleasure
      I feel, not merely in your public success, but in your public virtue.
      Talents, even the rare talent of oratory, you know, I hold cheap in
      comparison with that which is so far more rare, as well as more valuable&mdash;political
      integrity. The abhorrence and contempt of political profligacy, which you
      have just expressed, as a member of the senate, and the consistent conduct
      by which you have supported your principles, are worthy of you; and, allow
      me to say, of your education."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian felt exalted in his own opinion by such praise, and by these the
      warmest expressions he had ever received of Russell's regard. He forgot
      even his domestic uneasiness; and this day, the first for many months he
      had spent happily, he passed with his friend. They supped together, and
      related mutually all that happened since their parting. Russell told
      Vivian that he had lately been agreeably surprised by the gift of a
      valuable living from the Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;, Lady Julia Lidhurst's
      uncle; that the bishop, whom he had till then never seen, had written to
      him in the handsomest manner, saying that he knew the obligations his
      family owed to Mr. Russell; that it had been the dying request of his
      nephew, Lord Lidhurst, that some token of the family esteem and gratitude
      should be offered to him, to whom they owed so much; but the bishop added,
      that neither family gratitude nor private friendship could have induced
      him to bestow church preferments upon any but the person whose character
      best entitled him to such a distinction and such a trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter, as Vivian observed, was well calculated to satisfy Russell's
      conscience and his delicacy. The conversation next turned upon Lady Julia
      Lidhurst. Russell was not aware that Vivian knew more of her attachment to
      him than what had been discovered the day before he left Glistonbury; and
      Vivian could not help admiring the honourable and delicate manner in which
      his friend spoke of her, without any air of mystery, and with the greatest
      respect. He told Vivian he had heard that proposals had been lately made
      to her ladyship by a gentleman of great talents and of high character; but
      that she had positively declined his addresses, and had repeated her
      declaration that she would never marry. Her good uncle left her, on this
      point, entirely at liberty, and did not mention the proposal to Lord
      Glistonbury, lest she should be exposed to any fresh difficulties. Russell
      expressed much satisfaction at this part of the bishop's conduct, as being
      not only the most kind, but the most judicious, and the most likely to
      dispose his niece to change her determination. He repeated his opinion
      that, united to a man of sense and strength of mind, she would make a
      charming and excellent wife. Vivian agreed with him; yet observed, that he
      was convinced she would never marry&mdash;There he paused.&mdash;Could
      Lady Julia herself have overheard the conversation which afterwards passed
      between these two gentlemen, one of whom she had loved and the other of
      whom she had refused, not a word would have hurt her feelings: on the
      contrary, she would have been raised in her own opinion, and gratified by
      the strong interest they both showed for her happiness. They regretted
      only that a young woman of such talents, and of such a fine, generous
      disposition, had been so injudiciously educated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, my dear Russell," cried Vivian, "that we have finished the
      chapter of Lady Julia, let us talk of Miss Sidney."&mdash;Russell's change
      of countenance showed that it was not quite so easy for him to talk upon
      this subject.&mdash;To spare him the effort, Vivian resumed, "As you are a
      rich man now, my dear Russell, you will certainly marry; and I know,"
      added he, smiling, "that Miss Sidney will be your wife. If ever man
      deserved such a prize, you do; and I shall be the first to wish you joy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay, my good friend," interrupted Russell; "your kindness for me, and
      your imagination, are too quick in this anticipation of my happiness."&mdash;Russell
      then told him, that he never had declared his attachment to Selina till
      Vivian's marriage had put an end to all probability of rivalship with his
      friend. She had expressed high esteem for Russell, but had told him, that
      she had suffered so much from a first unfortunate attachment, that she
      felt averse from any new engagements.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I assure you, as you assured me just now with regard to Lady
      Julia," said Vivian, "that Miss Sidney will he prevailed upon to alter her
      determination; and shall I add, that, though I should like Lady Julia the
      less, I should like Selina the better, for changing her mind?"&mdash;He
      went on, generously expressing sincere hopes, that his friend might obtain
      Selina Sidney's affections, and might enjoy that domestic happiness, which&mdash;Vivian
      was going to say, which he had himself forfeited; but checking this
      regret, he only said&mdash;"that domestic happiness, which I consider as
      the summit of human felicity, and which no man can deserve better than you
      do, my dear Russell."
    </p>
    <p>
      Russell easily guessed that poor Vivian had not attained this summit of
      human felicity by his own marriage, but never adverted to any of the
      conversations they had held about Lady Sarah Lidhurst; never recalled any
      of Vivian's vehement declarations concerning the absolute impossibility of
      his making such a match; never evinced the least surprise at his marriage;
      nor inquired how he had conquered his passion for Lady Julia. With
      friendly forgetfulness, he seemed to have totally obliterated from his
      mind all that it could do no good to remember. Vivian was sensible of this
      delicacy, and grateful for it; but to imitate Russell's reserve and
      silence upon certain subjects required a force, a forbearance of which he
      was not capable. At first he had determined not to say one word to Russell
      of domestic uneasiness; but they had not been many hours together before
      Vivian poured forth all his complaints, and confessed how bitterly he
      repented his marriage: be declared that he had been persuaded, by the
      united efforts of her family and of his mother, against his own judgment,
      or, at least, against his taste and inclinations, to marry Lady Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By whatever persuasions, or by whatever motives, your choice was
      decided," interrupted Russell, "reflect that it is decided for life;
      therefore abide by it, and justify it. Above all, make yourself happy with
      the means which are yet in your power, instead of wasting your mind in
      unavailing regret. You are united to a woman who has every estimable
      quality, as you candidly acknowledge: there are some particulars in which
      she does not please your taste; but withdraw your attention from these,
      and you will be happy with a wife who is so firmly attached to you.
      Consider, besides, that&mdash;romance apart&mdash;love, though a
      delightful passion, is not the only resource which a man of sense, virtue,
      and activity may find for happiness. Your public duties, your success, and
      your reputation as a public character, will&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Russell was interrupted in this consolatory and invigorating speech, by
      the entrance of a servant of Lord Glistonbury's, who brought a note from
      his lordship to Mr. Vivian, requesting to see him as soon as he could make
      it convenient to come to Glistonbury House, as his lordship wanted to
      speak to him on particular business of the greatest importance. Vivian was
      provoked by being thus summoned away from his friend, to attend to one of
      what he called Lord Glistonbury's <i>important mysteries about nothing</i>.
      Russell was engaged to go into the country the ensuing day, to take
      possession of his new living; but he promised that he would see him again
      soon; and, with this hope, the two friends parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian went to Lord Glistonbury's: he found his lordship in his study.
      "Where have you been, Vivian?" exclaimed he: "I have sent messenger after
      messenger to look for you, half over the town: I thought you were to have
      dined with us, but you ran away, and nobody could tell where, or with
      whom; and we have been waiting for you at our cabinet council here with
      the utmost impatience."&mdash;Vivian answered, that he had unexpectedly
      met with his friend Russell; and was proceeding to tell his lordship how
      handsomely the Bishop of&mdash;&mdash;had provided for his friend; but
      Lord Glistonbury, like many other great men, having the habit of
      forgetting all the services of those from whom they have nothing more to
      expect, cut short Vivian's narration, by exclaiming, "True, true! well,
      well! that's all over now&mdash;Certainly, <i>that</i> Russell did his
      duty by my poor son; and acted as he ought to do&mdash;in all things; and
      I'm glad to hear my brother has given him a good living; and I hope, as
      you say, he will soon be married&mdash;so best&mdash;so best, you know,
      Vivian, for reasons of our own&mdash;Well! well! I'm glad he is provided
      for&mdash;not but what that living would have been of essential service,
      if it had been reserved for a friend of mine&mdash;but my brother the
      bishop never can enter into any political views&mdash;might as well not
      have a brother a bishop&mdash;But, however, Mr. Russell's a friend of
      yours&mdash;I am not regretting&mdash;not so rude to you to regret&mdash;&mdash;on
      the contrary, rejoice, particularly as Mr. Russell is a man of so much
      merit&mdash;But all that's over now; and I want to talk to you upon quite
      another matter. You know I have always said I should, sooner or later,
      succeed in my grand object, hey, Vivian?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your lordship's grand object?&mdash;I am not sure that I know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, surely, you know my grand object. You my son-in-law, and forget my
      grand object?&mdash;The marquisate, you know; the marquisate, the
      marquisate! Did not I always tell you that I would make government, sooner
      or later, change my earldom into a marquisate? Well! the thing is done&mdash;that
      is, as good as done; they have sent to treat with me upon my own terms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I give you joy, my dear lord!" said Vivian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Joy!&mdash;to be sure you do, my sober sir:&mdash;one would think you had
      no concern or interest in the business. Joy! to be sure you give me joy;
      but, I can tell you, you must give me something more than joy&mdash;you
      must give me support."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How he looks!" continued Lord Glistonbury, "as if he did not know what is
      meant by support. Vivian, did you never hear of parliamentary support?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope, my dear lord," replied Vivian, gravely, "that you have not
      entered into any engagements, or made any promises for me, which I cannot
      have it in my power to perform."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Glistonbury hesitated in some confusion; and then, forcing a look of
      effrontery, in an assured tone, replied, "No. I have not made any
      engagements or promises for you which you cannot perform, Vivian, I am
      clear; nor any which I have not a right to expect my son-in-law will
      confirm with alacrity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you engaged?&mdash;what have you promised for me, my lord?"
      said Vivian, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only, my dear boy," said Lord Glistonbury, assuming a facetious tone,
      "only that you will be always one of us&mdash;And are not you one of us?&mdash;my
      son-in-law?&mdash;the deuce is in it if he is not one of us!&mdash;In
      short, you know, to be serious, a party must go together, that is, a
      family party must go together; and, if a ministry do my business, of
      course I do theirs. If I have my marquisate, they have my votes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But not my vote&mdash;pardon me, my lord&mdash;my vote cannot be bartered
      in this manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, you know, Mr. Vivian, you know it is for your interest as much as
      for mine; for, you know, the marquisate will probably descend, in due
      course of time, to your son. So your interest is full as much concerned as
      mine; and besides, let me tell you, I have not forgotten your immediate
      interest: I have stipulated that you should have the valuable place which
      Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; was to have had."
    </p>
    <p>
      All that Russell had said of public virtue was fresh in our hero's mind.
      "I thank you, my dear lord," said he; "for I am sure this was kindly
      intended; but I am not one of those persons, who in public affairs think
      only of their private interest&mdash;I am not thinking of my interest. But
      if a man maintains certain public measures one day, and the next, for <i>valuable
      consideration</i>, supports diametrically opposite opinions and measures,
      he will lose, and deserve to lose, all reputation for integrity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Integrity! political integrity!" said Lord Glistonbury; "fine words,
      which mean nothing. Behind the scenes, as we are now, Vivian, what use can
      there be in talking in that strain?&mdash;Between you and me, you know
      this is all nonsense. For who, of any party, now thinks, really and truly,
      of any thing but getting power or keeping it? Power, you know, stands for
      the measure of talent; and every thing else worth having is included in
      that word power. I speak plainly. And as honour is merely an affair of
      opinion, and opinion, again, an affair of numbers, and as there are
      numbers enough to keep one in countenance in these things; really, my dear
      Vivian, it is quite childish, quite boyish, smells of the lamp. To declaim
      about political integrity, and all that, is not the language of a man who
      knows any thing of business&mdash;any thing of the world.&mdash;But why do
      I say all this?" cried Lord Glistonbury, checking himself and assuming an
      air of more reserved displeasure.&mdash;"Mr. Vivian certainly knows all
      this as well as I do; I know how my nephew Marmaduke, who, with all his
      faults, is no fool, would interpret your present language: he would say,
      as I have often heard him say, that political integrity is only a civil <i>put
      off</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Political integrity only a civil put off!" repeated Vivian, with
      unfeigned astonishment. When he formerly heard similar sentiments from the
      avowed profligate and hackneyed politician Mr. Wharton, he was shocked;
      but to hear them repeated, as being coolly laid down by so young a man as
      Mr. Lidhurst, excited so much disgust and contempt in Vivian's mind, that
      he could hardly refrain from saying more than either prudence or
      politeness could justify.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now I am free to confess," pursued Lord Glistonbury, "that I should think
      it more candid and manly, and, I will add, more friendly, and more the
      natural, open conduct of a son-in-law to a father-in-law, instead of
      talking of political integrity, to have said, at once, I cannot oblige you
      in this instance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely, my lord, you cannot be in earnest?" said Vivian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you, sir, I am in earnest," cried his lordship, turning suddenly
      in a rage, as he walked up and down the room; "I say, it would have been
      more candid, more manly, more every thing,&mdash;and much more like a
      son-in-law&mdash;much!&mdash;much!&mdash;&mdash;I am sure, if I had known
      as much as I do now, sir, you never should have been my son-in-law&mdash;never!
      never!&mdash;seen Lady Sarah in her grave first!&mdash;I would!&mdash;I
      would!&mdash;yes, sir&mdash;I would!&mdash;&mdash;And you are the last
      person upon earth I should have expected it from. But I have a nephew&mdash;I
      have a nephew, and now I know the difference. No man can distinguish his
      friends till he tries them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian in vain endeavoured to appease Lord Glistonbury by assurances that
      he would do any thing in his power to oblige him, except what he himself
      considered as dishonourable: his lordship reiterated, with divers
      passionate ejaculations, that if Vivian would not oblige him in this
      point, on which he had set his heart&mdash;where the great object of his
      life was at stake&mdash;he could never believe he had any regard for him;
      and that in short, it must come to an open rupture between them, for that
      he should never consider him more as his son. Having uttered this
      denunciation as distinctly as passion would permit, Lord Glistonbury
      retired to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian went immediately to his mother, to tell her what had passed, and he
      felt almost secure of her approbation; but though she praised him for his
      generous spirit of independence, yet it was evident the hopes that the
      title of marquis might descend to a grandson of her own weighed more with
      her than any patriotic considerations. She declared, that indeed she would
      not, for any title, or any thing upon earth, have her son act
      dishonourably; but what was asked of him, as far as she could understand,
      was only such a change of party, such compliances, as every public man in
      his place would make: and though she would not have him, like some she
      could name, a corrupt tool of government, yet, on the other hand, it was
      folly to expect that he alone could do any thing against the general tide
      of corruption&mdash;that it would be madness in him to sacrifice himself
      entirely, without the slightest possibility of doing any good to his
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian interrupted her, to represent that, if each public man argued in
      this manner, nothing could ever be accomplished for the public good: that,
      on the contrary, if every man hoped that something might be done, even by
      his individual exertion, and if he determined to sacrifice a portion of
      his private interest in the attempt, perhaps much might be effected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely!" Lady Mary said. She confessed she knew little of politics:
      so from argument she went to persuasion and entreaties. She conjured him
      not to quarrel with the Glistonburys, and not to provoke Lord
      Glistonbury's displeasure. "I see all that artful Marmaduke's schemes,"
      said she: "he knows his uncle's pertinacious temper; and he hopes that
      your notions of patriotism will prevent you from yielding on a point, on
      which his uncle has set his heart. Marmaduke will know how to take
      advantage of all this, believe me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian was shaken in his resolution by his mother's entreaties&mdash;by
      the idea of all the family quarrels that would ensue, and of all the
      difficulties in which he might be involved, if he persisted in his
      generous determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear son," resumed she, "it would be absolute madness to refuse the
      place that is now offered you: only consider the situation of your affairs&mdash;consider,
      I beseech you, the distress you will be in by and by, if you reject this
      offer&mdash;recollect the immense demands upon you; recollect that heap of
      bills for the election, and for the buildings, and all the poor workmen
      about the castle! and that coachmaker too! and remember, the purchase
      money of the house in town must be paid in three months. And the only
      possible means by which you can get out of debt, is by accepting this
      place, which would put you at ease at once, and enable you to continue in
      the style of life to which you have of late been accustomed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to that, I could alter my style of life&mdash;I would do any thing,"
      cried Vivian, "to pay my debts and preserve my independence. I will alter
      my mode of living, and retrench decidedly and vigorously."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear son, I admire your spirit, and, if you can do this, it will
      certainly be best; but I fear that when it comes to the trial, you will
      not be able to persevere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall&mdash;I shall! Believe me, mother, I have resolution enough for
      this&mdash;you do me injustice," said Vivian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear Charles, I do you justice; for I do not doubt your
      resolution, as far as your own privations are concerned; but, consider
      your wife&mdash;consider Lady Sarah&mdash;consider the luxury in which she
      has always been accustomed to live, and the high sphere in which her
      relations move! How her pride would be hurt by their looking down upon
      her! I have no doubt Lady Sarah would do her duty, and make any sacrifices
      for her husband; and if you were&mdash;I must now speak plainly&mdash;if
      you were passionately fond of her&mdash;an all-for-love husband&mdash;you
      could, with honour and propriety, accept of such sacrifices; but what
      would retirement be <i>to</i> poor Lady Sarah, and <i>with</i> Lady
      Sarah?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian told his mother that he would take a night to reconsider the matter
      coolly; and, satisfied with having gained so much, she suffered him to go
      home. As he was quitting his own dressing-room, he paused, to consider
      whether he should consult his wife, who was, as yet, in ignorance of the
      whole transaction, and who knew nothing of the deranged state of his
      affairs. He did her the justice to believe that she would be willing to
      live with him in retirement, and to forego all the luxuries and pride of
      her rank, for the sake of her duty and of her love. He was convinced that,
      in any opposition between her father's interests and her husband's honour,
      she would strongly abide by her husband. He recollected all Lady Julia had
      said of the advantage that her sister's firmness of mind might be in
      steadying his vacillating temper in any moment of trial. Here was the
      first <i>great occasion</i>, since his marriage, where his wife's strength
      of mind could be of essential service to him: yet he hesitated whether he
      should avail himself of this advantage; and every moment, as he approached
      nearer to her apartment, he hesitated more and more; He did not, in the
      first place, like to humble himself so far as to ask her counsel; then he
      had not courage to confess those debts and embarrassments which he had
      hitherto concealed. All that his mother had suggested about the indelicacy
      of requiring or accepting great sacrifices from a woman whom, though he
      esteemed, he could not love&mdash;the horror of retirement with such a
      companion&mdash;the long years <i>tête-à-tête</i>&mdash;all these ideas
      combined, but chiefly the apprehension of the immediate present pain of
      speaking to her on a disagreeable subject, and of being obliged to hear
      her speak with that formal deliberation which he detested; added to this,
      the dread of her surprise, if not of her reproaches, when all his affairs
      should be revealed, operated so irresistibly upon his weakness, that he
      decided on the common resource&mdash;concealment. His hand was upon the
      lock of his chamber-door, and he turned it cautiously and softly, lest, in
      entering his apartment, he should waken Lady Sarah: but she was not
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can have kept you so late, Mr. Vivian?" said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Business, my dear," answered he, with some embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I ask what sort of business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!&mdash;only&mdash;political business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Political business!" She looked earnestly at her husband; but, as if
      repressing her curiosity, she afterwards added, "our sex have nothing to
      do with politics," and, turning away from the light, she composed herself
      to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true, my dear," replied Vivian&mdash;not a word more did he say:
      content with this evasion of the difficulty, he thus, by his weakness,
      deprived himself of the real advantage of his wife's strength of mind.
      Whilst Lady Sarah, in total ignorance of the distress of her husband,
      slept in peace, he lay awake, revolving painful thoughts in the silence of
      the night. All that his mother had said about the pecuniary difficulties
      to which they must soon be reduced recurred with fresh force; the ideas of
      the unpaid election bills, all the masons', carpenters', painters',
      glaziers', and upholsterers' bills, with "thousands yet unnamed behind,"
      rose, in dreadful array, before him, and the enthusiasm of his patriotism
      was appalled. With feverish reiteration, he ran over and over, in his
      mind, the same circle of difficulties, continually returning to the
      question, "<i>Then what can be done?</i>" Bitterly did he this night
      regret the foolish expenses into which he had early in life been led. If
      it were to do over again, he certainly would not turn his house into a
      castle; if he had foreseen how much the expense would surpass the
      estimates, assuredly nothing could have tempted him to such extravagance.
      The architect, the masons, the workmen, one and all, were knaves; but, one
      and all, they must be paid. Then what could he do?&mdash;And the debts
      incurred by the contested elections!&mdash;contested elections are cursed
      things, when the bills come to be paid; but, cursed or not, they must be
      paid. Then what could he do?&mdash;The distress in which he should involve
      his generous mother&mdash;the sacrifices he should require from his wife&mdash;the
      family quarrels&mdash;all that Lady Sarah would suffer from them&mdash;the
      <i>situation</i> of his wife. Then what could he do?&mdash;He MUST submit
      to Lord Glistonbury, and take the place that was offered to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian sighed&mdash;and turned in his bed&mdash;and sighed&mdash;and
      thought&mdash;and turned&mdash;and sighed again&mdash;and the last sigh of
      expiring patriotism escaped him!&mdash;&mdash;To this end, to this
      miserable end, must all patriotism come, which is not supported by the
      seemingly inferior virtues of prudence and economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Vivian endeavoured to comfort himself by the reflection that he
      should not act from merely mercenary considerations, but that he was
      compelled to yield to the solicitations of his mother and of his
      father-in-law; that he was forced to sacrifice his own public opinions to
      secure domestic peace, and to prevent the distress of his mother, the
      misery, and perhaps danger, of his wife and child. Dereliction of
      principle, in these circumstances, was something like an amiable, a
      pardonable weakness. And then, see it in what light you will, as Lord
      Glistonbury observed, "there are so many who will keep a patriot in
      countenance now-a-days, for merely changing sides in politics. A man is
      not even thought to be a man of talents till he gets something by his
      talents. The bargain he makes&mdash;the price he gains&mdash;is, in most
      people's estimation, the value of the public man."
    </p>
    <p>
      All this Vivian said to himself to quiet his conscience; and all this, he
      knew, would be <i>abundantly satisfactory</i> to the generality of people
      with whom he associated; therefore, from them he could fear neither
      reproach nor contempt: but he could not bear even to think of Russell&mdash;he
      felt all the pangs of remorse, and agony of shame, as the idea of such a
      friend came into his mind. Again he turned in his bed, and groaned aloud&mdash;so
      loud, that Lady Sarah wakened, and, starting up, asked what was the
      matter; but receiving no answer, she imagined that she had been in a
      dream, or that her husband had spoken in his sleep. He groaned no more,
      nor did he even sigh: but fatigued with thinking and with feeling, he at
      last fell into a sort of slumber, which lasted till it was time to rise.
      Before Vivian was dressed, Lord Glistonbury called upon him&mdash;he went
      into his dressing-room. His lordship came with his best address, and most
      courteous face of persuasion; he held out his hand, in a frank and cordial
      manner, as he entered, begging his dear son's pardon for the warmth and
      want of temper, he was free to confess, he had shown last night; but he
      was persuaded, he said, that Vivian knew his sincere regard for him, and
      convinced that, in short, they should never <i>essentially</i> differ: so
      that he was determined to come to talk the matter over with him when they
      were both cool; and that he felt assured that Vivian, after a night's
      reflection, would always act so as to justify his preference of his
      son-in-law to his nephew, hey, Vivian?&mdash;Lord Glistonbury paused for
      an answer&mdash;Vivian cut himself as he was shaving, and was glad of a
      moment's reprieve; instead of answering, he only exclaimed, "Cursed razor!
      cut myself!&mdash;My lord, won't you sit down? will you do me the honour
      to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Glistonbury seated himself; and, in regular order, with his tiresome
      parade of expletives, went through all the arguments that could be adduced
      to prove the expediency of Vivian's taking this place, and assisting him,
      as he had taken it for granted his son-in-law would, on such an occasion.
      The letters of the great and little men who had negotiated the business of
      the marquisate were then produced, and an account given of all that had
      passed <i>in confidence</i>; and Lord Glistonbury finished by saying that
      the affair was absolutely concluded, he having passed his word and pledged
      his honour for Vivian; that he would not have spoken or acted for him if
      he had not felt that he was, when acting for his son-in-law, in fact
      acting for himself&mdash;his second self; that there had been no time to
      wait, no possibility of consulting Vivian; that the whole plan was
      suggested yesterday, in two hours after the house broke up, and was
      arranged in the evening; that search and inquiries had been made every
      where for Vivian; but, as he could not be found, Lord Glistonbury said he
      had ventured to decide for him, and, as he hoped, for his interest and for
      that of the family; and the thing, now done, could not be undone: his
      lordship's word was sacred, and could not be retracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian, in a feeble, irresolute tone, asked if there was no possibility of
      his being allowed to decline the place that was offered him, and suggested
      that he could take a middle course; to avoid voting against his lordship's
      wishes, he could, and he believed that he would, accept of the Chiltern
      Hundreds, and go out of parliament for the session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Glistonbury remonstrated against what he termed the madness of the
      scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man like you, my dear Vivian, who have distinguished yourself so much
      already in opposition, who will distinguish yourself so much more
      hereafter in place and in power&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Vivian, rising as he finished shaving himself; "no, my lord, I
      shall never more distinguish myself, if I abandon the principles I believe
      to be just and true. What eloquence I have&mdash;if I have any&mdash;has
      arisen from my being in earnest: I shall speak ill&mdash;I shall not be
      able to speak at all&mdash;when I get up against my conscience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Lord Glistonbury, laughing, "your romantic patriotism may be
      very nice in its feelings; but, believe me, it will not deprive you of the
      use of your speech. Look at every one of the fine orators of our times,
      and name me one, if you can, who has not spoken, and spoken equally well,
      on both sides of the house; ay, and on both sides of most political
      questions. Come, come, you'll find you will get on quite as well as they
      got on before you, hey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will find that I shall be of no use to you&mdash;that I shall be a
      dead weight on your hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You a dead weight! you, who are formed to be&mdash;now, really, without
      flattery&mdash;you know there's no occasion for flattery between you and
      me&mdash;to be the soul, and, in time, the head of a party&mdash;&mdash;Stay!&mdash;I
      know all you are going to say, but give me leave to judge&mdash;You know
      there's my own nephew, a very clever young man, no doubt, he is allowed to
      be; and yet, you see, I make no comparison between you. I assure you I am
      a judge in these matters, and you see the house has confirmed my judgment;
      and, what is more&mdash;for I can keep nothing from you&mdash;if it won't
      make you too vain, and make you set too high a price upon yourself, which
      will be very troublesome in the present case; but, I say, be that as it
      may, I will frankly own to you, that I believe you have been of essential
      service in procuring me this great favourite object of my life, the
      marquisate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, my lord! impossible!&mdash;for I never took the slightest step toward
      procuring it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, you took the most effectual step, without knowing it, perhaps.
      You spoke so well in opposition, that you made it the interest of ministry
      to <i>muzzle you</i>; and there was no way so effectual of getting at you
      as through me, I being your father-in-law and you my heir. You don't see
      the secret concatenation of these things with a glance as I do, who have
      been used to them so long. And there was no way of coming to the point
      with me without the marquisate&mdash;that was my <i>sine qua non</i>; and
      you see I gained my point&mdash;by your means, chiefly, I am free to allow&mdash;though
      Marmaduke would gladly persuade me it was by his negotiating. But I do you
      justice; I did you justice, too, in more than words, when I stipulated for
      that place for you, which, in fact, I knew you could not go on much longer
      without. So, my dear Vivian, all this explained to our mutual
      satisfaction, we have nothing more to do but to shake hands upon it and go
      down stairs; for I have engaged myself and Secretary&mdash;&mdash;to
      breakfast with you, and he has <i>full powers</i>, and is to carry back
      our <i>capitulation</i>&mdash;and," continued Lord Glistonbury, looking
      out of the window, "here's our friend's carriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my lord, it is not yet too late!" cried Vivian; "it may yet be
      arranged otherwise. Is there no way&mdash;no possibility&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud knock at the house door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to Heaven, my lord!&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So do I wish to Heaven, with all my soul, that you would finish this
      nonsense, my dear Vivian, and come down to breakfast. Come, come, come!&mdash;Hey,
      hey, hey!&mdash;This is absolutely too ridiculous, and I must go, if you
      don't. Only consider a political breakfast of this nature!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Glistonbury hurried down stairs:&mdash;reluctantly, and with a heavy
      heart and repugnant conscience, Vivian followed. At this instant, he
      wished for Russell, to prevent what he knew would be the consequence of
      this interview. But Russell was absent&mdash;the keeper of his conscience,
      the supporter of his resolution, was not at hand. Woe to him who is not
      the keeper of his own conscience&mdash;the supporter of his own
      resolution! The result of this political breakfast was just what every
      reader, who knows the world but half as well as Lord Glistonbury knew it,
      has probably long since anticipated. The capitulation of the patriots of
      the Glistonbury band, with Vivian at their head, was settled. Lord
      Glistonbury lost no character by this transaction, for he had none to lose&mdash;he
      was quite at his ease, or quite callous. But Vivian bartered, for a paltry
      <i>accommodation</i> of his pecuniary difficulties, a reputation which
      stood high in the public opinion&mdash;which was invaluable in his own&mdash;which
      was his last stake of happiness. He knew this&mdash;he felt it with all
      the anguish of exquisite but USELESS sensibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Glistonbury and his new friend, Secretary &mdash;&mdash;, who was a
      man of wit as well as a politician, rallied Vivian upon his gravity and
      upon his evident depression of spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, my dear Vivian," cried Lord Glistonbury, "my patience is now
      exhausted, and I must not let you expose yourself here, before our friend,
      as a novice&mdash;Hey! hey!&mdash;Why, will you never open your eyes, and
      see the world as it is! Why! what!&mdash;Did you never read the fable of
      the dog and his master's meat?&mdash;Well! it is come to that now in
      England; and he is a foolish dog, indeed, who, when he can't save the
      meat, won't secure his share&mdash;hey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship and the secretary laughed in concert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look, how Vivian preserves his solemnity!" continued Lord Glistonbury;
      "and he really looks as if he was surprised at us. My dear Vivian, it
      requires all my knowledge of your <i>bonne foi</i> to believe that you are
      in earnest, and not acting the part of a patriot of <i>older</i> times."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" cried the secretary, with a facetious air, "Mr. Vivian assuredly
      knows, as well as we do, that&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'A patriot is a fool in ev'ry age, Whom all lord chamberlains allow the
      stage.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But off the stage we lay aside heroics, or how should we ever get on?&mdash;Did
      you hear, my lord," continued the secretary, turning to Lord Glistonbury,
      "that there is another blue riband fallen in to us by the death of Lord G&mdash;&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had a great regard for poor Lord G&mdash;&mdash;. Many applications, I
      suppose, for the vacant riband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      From the vacant riband they went on to talk over this man's pension and
      the other man's job; and considered who was to get such and such a place
      when such and such a person should resign or succeed to something better.
      Then all the miserable mysteries of ministerial craft were unveiled to
      Vivian's eyes. He had read, he had heard, he had believed, that public
      affairs were conducted in this manner; but he had never, till now,
      actually seen it: he was really novice enough still to feel surprise at
      finding that, after all the fine professions made on all sides, the main,
      the only object of these politicians, was to keep their own, or to get
      into the places of others. Vivian felt every moment his disgust and his
      melancholy increase. "And it is with these people I have consented to act!
      And am I to be hurried along by this stream of corruption to infamy and
      oblivion! Then Russell&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian resolved to retract the engagement he had just made with Lord
      Glistonbury and the secretary, and he waited only for a pause in their
      conversation to explain himself. But, before any pause occurred, more
      company came in,&mdash;the secretary hurried away, saying to Vivian, who
      would have stopped him at the door, "Oh, my dear sir, every thing is
      settled now, and you must be with us in the house to-night&mdash;and you
      will find the whole business will go on as smoothly as possible, if
      gentlemen will but act together, and strengthen the hands of government. I
      beg pardon for breaking away&mdash;but so many people are waiting for me&mdash;and
      any thing further we can settle when we meet in the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Glistonbury also refused to listen to farther explanations&mdash;said
      that all was settled, and that it was impossible to make any recantations.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The hour of going to the House of Commons at length arrived; Lord
      Glistonbury saw that Vivian was so much out of spirits, and in such
      confusion of mind, that he began to fear that our hero's own account of
      himself was just, and that he would not be able to command ideas, or even
      words, when he was to speak in opposition to what he called his principles
      and his conscience. "This son of mine, instead of being our great Apollo,
      will be a dead weight on our hands, unless we can contrive to raise his
      spirits."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, to raise his spirits, Lord Glistonbury accompanied him to the
      coffee-room of the house, and insisted upon his taking some refreshment
      before he should attempt to speak. His lordship <i>fortified</i> him with
      bumper after bumper, till at last Vivian came up to the speaking point. He
      took his seat in his new place in the house, and, endeavouring to brave
      away the sense of shame, rose to speak. Notwithstanding the assistance of
      the wine, and the example of Mr. Marmaduke Lidhurst, who spoke before him
      with undaunted assurance, Vivian could scarcely get on with a hesitating,
      confused, inconsistent speech, uttered in so low and indistinct a voice,
      that the reporters in the gallery complained that they could not catch
      this honourable member's meaning, or that his words did not reach them.
      Conscious of his failure, and still more conscious of its cause, he
      retired again to the coffee-room as soon as he had finished speaking, and
      again Lord Glistonbury plied him with wine, saying that he would find he
      would <i>do very well in reply</i> presently. It happened that Lord
      Glistonbury was called away&mdash;Vivian remained. Mr. Wharton, with a
      party of his friends, entered the coffee-room. Wharton seemed much heated
      both with wine and anger&mdash;he was talking eagerly to the gentlemen
      with him, and he pronounced the words, "Infamous conduct!&mdash;Shabby!&mdash;Paltry
      fellow!" so loud, that all the coffee-room turned to listen. Colonel S&mdash;&mdash;,
      a gentleman who was one of Wharton's party, but who had a good opinion of
      Vivian, at this moment took him by the arm, and, drawing him aside,
      whispered, in confidence, that he was persuaded there had been some <i>mistake</i>
      in the arrangements, which, as it was reported, Lord Glistonbury had just
      made with the ministry, for that Mr. Wharton and many of his lordship's
      former party, complained of having been shamefully deserted. "And to break
      our word and honour to our party, is a thing no gentleman <i>can</i> do.
      Wharton had a direct promise from his lordship, that he never would <i>come
      in</i> till he should <i>come in</i> along with him. And now it is
      confidently said, that Lord Glistonbury has made his bargain for his own
      marquisate, and provided only for himself, his nephew, and his
      son-in-law."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thrown into the utmost consternation by the idea of this double forfeiture
      of honour, this breach both of public and private faith, Vivian, after
      thanking Colonel S&mdash;&mdash; for his friendly manner of communicating
      this information, and declaring that the transaction was totally unknown
      to him, begged that the colonel would do him the favour and the justice to
      be present when he should require an explanation from Lord Glistonbury. To
      this Colonel S&mdash;&mdash; consented, and they hastened in search of his
      lordship: his lordship was not to be found; but Mr. Marmaduke Lidhurst
      was, however, in the coffee-room, and upon Vivian's referring to him, he
      could not deny the truth of the charge, though he used all his powers of
      circumlocution to evade giving a direct answer. The shame, the
      indignation, that rapidly succeeded to each other in Vivian's countenance,
      sufficiently convinced Colonel S&mdash;&mdash; that he had no share in the
      <i>private</i> part of this disgraceful transaction; and he very
      handsomely assured Vivian, that he would set the matter in its true point
      of view with his friends. Marmaduke soon found a pretence to withdraw&mdash;some
      member was speaking in the house, whom he must hear, he said, and away he
      went.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Mr. Wharton, who was walking down the room with his
      friends, passed by Vivian, and, as he passed, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "That <i>private vices are public benefits</i>, we all know; but that
      public vices are private benefits, some of us, alas! have yet to learn.
      But I'd have that little, whiffling, <i>most noble and puissant prince</i>
      expectant, his majesty's <i>right trusty and entirely beloved cousin</i>
      elect, know, that plain Bob Wharton is not a man to be duped and deserted
      with impunity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom does he mean?&mdash;What does he mean?" whispered some of the
      bystanders. "What prince is he talking of?&mdash;Which of the princes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! none of the princes," replied another. "You know <i>most noble and
      puissant prince</i> is the title of a marquis, and <i>our right trusty and
      entirely beloved cousin</i>, the style in which the king writes to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But who is this marquis expectant?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you know?&mdash;Lord Glistonbury."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But some of his lordship's friends ought to take it up, surely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!&mdash;his son-in-law will hear you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There&mdash;don't look!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian was, with reason, so much exasperated by the treacherous duplicity
      of Lord Glistonbury's conduct, that he was ill inclined to undertake his
      lordship's defence, and determined to leave it to himself, or to his
      nephew; yet the whispers operated not a little upon his weakness. Wharton,
      who was walking with his set up and down the room, again came within
      Vivian's hearing, and, as he passed, exclaimed, "<i>Public vice!</i> and
      <i>public virtue!</i> precious, well-matched pair!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is <i>public vice</i>, and who is <i>public virtue</i>?" said one of
      Wharton's companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you know?" replied Wharton: "the heir-at-law and the son-in-law."
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing this speech, Vivian, who knew that he was one of the persons to
      whom it alluded, started forward to demand an explanation from Wharton:
      but Colonel S&mdash;&mdash; held him back. "You are not called upon, by
      any means, to take notice of this," said the colonel: "Wharton did not
      address himself to you, and though he might mean what he said for you, yet
      he speaks under a false impression; and besides, he is not quite sober.
      Leave it to me, and I will settle it all to your satisfaction before
      to-morrow." Vivian listened unwillingly and uneasily to the friendly
      counsel: he was more hurt than he had ever before felt himself by any of
      Wharton's sarcasms, because there was now in them a mixture of truth; and
      a man seldom feels more irritable than when he is conscious that he is
      partly to blame, and apprehensive that others will think him more
      blameable than he really is. His irritability was increased by the
      whispers he had heard, and the looks he now perceived among the
      bystanders: the voice, the opinion of numbers, the fear of what others
      would think or say, operated against his better judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come," said Colonel S&mdash;&mdash;, "let us go and see what they are
      doing in the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian refused to stir, saying that it would be leaving the field to
      Wharton. Wharton at this instant repassed; and still running the changes,
      with half-intoxicated wit, upon the same ideas, reiterated, "<i>Public
      vice!</i>&mdash;We all knew where <i>that</i> would end in these days&mdash;in
      public honours; but none of you would believe me, when I told you where <i>public
      virtue</i> would end&mdash;in private treachery!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's neat!&mdash;that's strong!&mdash;faith, that's home!" whispered
      some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Wharton!" cried Vivian, going up to him, "I could not help hearing
      what you said just now&mdash;did you intend it for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You heard it, it seems, sir, and that is sufficient," replied Wharton, in
      an insolent tone: "as to what I meant, I presume it is pretty evident;
      but, if you think it requires any explanation, I am as ready to give as
      you can be to ask it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sooner the better, then, sir," said Vivian. The two gentlemen walked
      away together, whilst the spectators exclaimed, "Very spirited indeed!&mdash;very
      right!&mdash;very proper!&mdash;Vivian could do no less than call him out.
      But, after all, what was the quarrel about? Which of them was to blame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before these points were settled, the challenge was given and
      accepted. Colonel S&mdash;&mdash;, who followed Vivian and Wharton,
      endeavoured to set things to rights, by explaining that Vivian had been
      deceived by Lord Glistonbury, and kept totally in the dark respecting the
      negotiation for the marquisate. But Wharton, aware that by <i>taking up
      the matter immediately in such a spirited way</i> he should do himself
      infinite honour with his party, and with that majority of the world who
      think that the greatest merit of a man is to stand to be shot at, was not
      at all willing to listen to these representations. Colonel S&mdash;&mdash;declared
      that, were he in Mr. Wharton's place, he should, without hesitation, make
      an apology to Mr. Vivian, and publicly acknowledge that what he said in
      the coffee-room was spoken under a false impression, which a plain
      statement of facts had totally removed: but Wharton disdained all terms of
      accommodation; his policy, pride, and desire of revenge, all conspired to
      produce that air of insolent determination to fight, which, with some
      people, would obtain the glorious name of COURAGE. By this sort of courage
      can men of the most base and profligate characters often put themselves in
      a moment upon an equal footing with men of principle and virtue!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was settled that Mr. Wharton and Vivian should meet, at eight o'clock
      the next morning, in a field near town. Colonel S&mdash;&mdash; consented
      to be Vivian's second. Russell was not yet returned&mdash;not expected
      till ten the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to his cool reflection, Vivian thought with horror of the misery into
      which the event of this duel might involve all with whom he was connected,
      and all who were attached to him. The affair was of course to be kept a
      secret from all at Glistonbury House, where Vivian was engaged to dine
      with a large ministerial party. He went home to dress, hoping to have a
      quarter of an hour to himself; but, on entering his own dressing-room, he,
      to his surprise and mortification, found his wife seated there, waiting
      for him with a face of anxious expectation; a case of newly-set diamonds
      on a table beside her. "I thought you were at your father's, my dear: are
      you not to be at Glistonbury House to-day?" said Vivian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Lady Sarah. "Surely, Mr. Vivian, you know that my father
      gives a political dinner, and I suppose you are to be there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes!" cried Vivian; "I did not know what I was saying&mdash;I am to
      be there, and must dress (looking at his watch), for I have no time to
      spare."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be that as it may, I must intrude upon your time for a few minutes," said
      Lady Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian stood impatiently attentive, whilst Lady Sarah seemed to find it
      difficult to begin some speech which she had prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Women, I know, have nothing to do with politics," she began in a
      constrained voice; but, suddenly quitting her air and tone of constraint,
      she started up and exclaimed, "Oh, my dear, <i>dear</i> husband! what have
      you done?&mdash;No, no, I cannot, will not believe it, till I hear it from
      your OWN lips!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter, my dear Lady Sarah?&mdash;You astonish and almost
      alarm me!" said Vivian, endeavouring to preserve composure of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not&mdash;Heaven forbid that I should alarm you as I have been
      alarmed!" said Lady Sarah, commanding her voice again to a tone of
      tranquillity. "I ought, and, if I were not weak, should be convinced that
      there is no reason for alarm. There has been some mistake, no doubt; and I
      have been to blame for listening to idle reports. Let me, however, state
      the facts. Half an hour ago, I was at Gray's the jeweller's, to call for
      my poor mother's diamonds, which, you know, he has reset&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;Well!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And whilst I was in the shop, a party of gentlemen came in, all of them
      unknown to me, and, of course, I was equally unknown to them; for they
      began to speak of you in a manner in which none knowing me could venture
      in my presence. They said&mdash;I cannot bear to repeat or to think of
      what they said&mdash;you cannot have bartered your public reputation for a
      marquisate for my father!&mdash;You cannot have done that which is
      dishonourable&mdash;you cannot have deserted your party for a paltry place
      for yourself!&mdash;You turn pale.&mdash;I wish, if it pleased God, that I
      was this moment in my grave!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven forbid, my dear Lady Sarah!" cried Vivian, forcing a smile, and
      endeavouring to speak in a tone of raillery. "Why should you wish to be in
      your grave, because your husband has just got a good warm place? Live!
      live!" said he, raising her powerless hand; "for consider&mdash;as I did&mdash;and
      this consideration was of no small weight with me&mdash;consider, my dear
      Sarah, how much better you will live for it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you did consider me? And that <i>did</i> weigh with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;Oh, this is what I dreaded most!" cried Lady Sarah.&mdash;"When
      will you know my real character? When will you have confidence in your
      wife, sir? When will you know the power, the unconquered, unconquerable
      power of her affection for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian, much struck by the strength of her expression as she uttered these
      words, was a moment silent in astonishment; and then could only, in an
      incoherent manner, protest, that he did know&mdash;that he had always done
      justice to her character&mdash;that he believed in her affection&mdash;and
      had the greatest confidence in its power.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, no!&mdash;Do not say that which I cannot credit!&mdash;You have
      not confidence in the power of my affection, or you would never have done
      this thing to save me pain. What pain can be so great to me as the thought
      of my husband's reputation suffering abasement?&mdash;Do you think that,
      in comparison with this, I, your wife, could put the loss of a service of
      plate, or house in town, or equipage, or servants, or such baubles as
      these?" added she, her eyes glancing upon the diamonds; then, snatching
      them up, "Take them, take them!" cried she; "they were my mother's; and if
      her spirit could look down from heaven upon us she would approve my offer&mdash;she
      would command your acceptance. Then here on my knees I conjure you, my
      beloved husband, take them&mdash;sell them&mdash;sell plate, furniture,
      house, equipage, sell every thing rather than your honour!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is sold," said Vivian, in a voice of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Redeem it, redeem it at any price!" cried Lady Sarah. "No! I will kneel
      here at your feet&mdash;you shall not raise me&mdash;till I have obtained
      this promise, this justice to me, to yourself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is too late," said Vivian, writhing in agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never too late," cried Lady Sarah. "Give up the place.&mdash;Never too
      late!&mdash;Give up the place&mdash;write this moment, and all will be
      well; for your honour will be saved, and the rest is as nothing in my
      eyes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "High-minded woman!" cried Vivian: "why did not I hear you sooner? Why did
      not I avail myself of your strength of soul?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Use it now&mdash;hear me now&mdash;let us waste no time in words&mdash;here
      is a pen and ink&mdash;write, my dearest husband! and be yourself again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You waste the energy of your mind on me," cried Vivian, breaking from
      Lady Sarah, and striking his forehead violently; "I am not worthy of such
      attachment! It is done&mdash;it cannot be undone: I am a weak, ruined,
      dishonoured wretch!&mdash;I tell you, it CANNOT be undone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Sarah rose, and stood in despair. Then, looking up to heaven, she was
      silent for some moments. After which, approaching her husband, she said,
      in an altered, calm voice, "Since it cannot be undone, I will urge you no
      more. But, whether in glory or in shame, you are secure that your wife
      will abide by you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian embraced her with a tenderness which he had never before felt.
      "Excellent woman! in justice to myself, I must tell you," cried he, "that
      I was deceived into this situation. I CAN say no more!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a servant knocked at the door, bringing a message from Lord
      Glistonbury, to say that all the company were assembled, and that dinner
      waited for Mr. Vivian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not in a fit state to go. Shall I send an apology to my father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no! I must go," cried Vivian, starting up, "I must go, or it will be
      thought&mdash;or it will be suspected&mdash;I can't explain it to you, my
      dear; but I must go&mdash;I must <i>appear</i> to-day, and in spirits too,
      if possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurried away. A servant delivered to Lady Sarah a number of notes and
      cards. The notes were notes of congratulation, from many of her
      acquaintance, upon the report in circulation, that her father was
      immediately to be a marquis. The cards were from people who were to be at
      her assembly that night. This was one of <i>her nights</i>, which were
      usually crowded. Lady Sarah's first wish was to write apologies, and to
      say that she was not well enough to see company; but, recollecting that
      her husband had said, "he must <i>appear</i>, and in spirits, too, if
      possible," she thought that it might be more for their interest, and
      according to his wishes, that she should see company, and that no
      appearance of dejection should be discerned in his wife. She prepared
      herself accordingly, and, with a heavy heart, walked through her splendid
      apartments, to see whether the decorations had been properly executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time Vivian dined at Lord Glistonbury's, with a large
      ministerial party. As soon as he could, after dinner, Vivian got away; and
      Lord Glistonbury attributed his retiring early to the awkwardness he might
      feel in the company of men whom he had, till now, so violently opposed.
      This his lordship thought a foolish <i>young man's feeling,</i> which
      would soon wear away. Vivian returned home, anxious to escape from crowds,
      and to have some hours of leisure to pass alone; but, the moment he
      entered his own house, he saw the great staircase lined with roses and
      orange-trees; he found the rooms lighted up and prepared for company; and
      Lady Sarah dressed, for the first time, in all her mother's diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens!&mdash;Do you see company to-night?" cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; for I thought, my dear, that you would wish it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish it!&mdash;Oh! if you knew how I wish to be alone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, as no one is yet come, I can still shut my doors, and order them to
      say that I am not well enough to see company&mdash;I am sure it is true.
      Shall I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear, it is too late," said Vivian: "I am afraid it is impossible
      for you to do that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not impossible, if you wish it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, do as you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which is most for your interest? I have no other pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are too good to me, and I fear I shall never have it in my power to
      show you any gratitude&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But decide which is best to be done, my dear," said Lady Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, my dear, I believe you judged rightly&mdash;see your friends, and
      make the best of it: but I can appear only for a moment; I have business
      of consequence&mdash;letters&mdash;papers&mdash;that must be finished
      to-night; and I must go now to my study."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall not be interrupted," said Lady Sarah: "I will exert myself as
      much as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      A tremendous knock at the door.&mdash;Vivian passed through the saloon,
      and gained his study, where, after remaining for some time in painful
      reflection, he was roused by hearing the clock strike twelve. He
      recollected that he had several arrangements to make in his affairs this
      night; and that it was incumbent on him to sign and execute a will, which
      had been for some time in his possession, with certain blanks not yet
      filled up. His wife was, by his marriage settlements, amply provided for;
      but he inserted in his will some clauses which he thought would add to her
      peculiar comfort, and took care to word them so that his respect and
      esteem should be known hereafter to all the world; and that, if he died,
      he should leave her the consolation of knowing that his last feelings for
      her were those of gratitude and affection. To his mother he left all that
      was in his power to contribute to the ease of her declining years&mdash;often
      obliged to pause whilst he wrote, overcome by the thoughts of what her
      grief would be if he died. He left his friend Russell <i>in remainder</i>,
      to a considerable part of his estate; and he was just adding the bequest
      of certain books, which they had read together in his better days, when
      the door of the study suddenly opened, and his mother entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is all this?" cried she: "immersed in papers at such a time as
      this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I so hate crowded assemblies," said Vivian, huddling his papers together,
      and advancing to meet his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So do I," said Lady Mary; "but I have been waiting with exemplary
      patience where I was stationed by Lady Sarah, at the card-table, every
      instant expecting your arrival, that I might have a few minutes'
      conversation with you, and inquire how matters went on at the house, and
      congratulate&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she had finished the word <i>congratulate</i>, she stopped short;
      for she had, by this time, a full view of her son's countenance: and she
      knew that countenance so well, that it was impossible to disguise it so as
      to deceive her maternal penetration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear son!" said she, "something is going wrong: I conjure you, tell me
      what is the matter!"&mdash;Her eye glanced upon the parchments, and she
      saw that it was a will. Vivian forced a laugh; and asked her if she had
      the weakness some people felt, of disliking to see a will, or of fancying
      that a man was going to die if he made his will. Then, to quiet her
      apprehensions, and to put a stop to her farther inquiries, he threw aside
      his papers, and returned with her to the company, where he exerted himself
      to appear as gay as the occasion required. Lord Glistonbury, who had
      called in for a few moments, was now playing the great man, as well as his
      total want of dignity of mind and manners would permit; he was answering,
      in whispers, questions about his marquisate, and sustaining with all his
      might his new part of the friend of government. Every thing conspired to
      strike Vivian with melancholy&mdash;yet he constrained himself so far,
      that his <i>charming spirits</i> delighted all who were uninterested in
      observing any but the external signs of gaiety; but his mother saw that
      his vivacity was forced. She made inquiries from all the gentlemen of her
      acquaintance about what had passed the preceding day both at the House of
      Commons, and to-day at the dinner at Lord Glistonbury's: but those who had
      been at Lord Glistonbury's dinner assured her that every thing had been as
      amicable as could be; and his ministerial friends said that every thing
      had gone on as smoothly as possible at the house: of what had passed
      between Mr. Wharton and Vivian in the coffee-room <i>nobody could</i> give
      her an account. Baffled, but not satisfied, the anxious mother sent to the
      hotel where Mr. Russell lodged, to inquire whether he was returned to
      town, and to beg to see him immediately. From him, she thought, she should
      learn the truth; or, by his influence over her son, she hoped that, if
      there was any danger of a quarrel, it might be in time prevented. Her
      servant, however, brought word that Mr. Russell was not expected from the
      country till ten o'clock the next morning; but that her note would be
      given to him directly on his arrival. She applied herself next to the
      study of her daughter's countenance, whilst she asked two or three
      questions, calculated to discover whether Lady Sarah was under any anxiety
      about Vivian. But though Lady Sarah's countenance exhibited not the
      slightest variation under this trial, yet this tranquillity was by no
      means decisively satisfactory; because, whatever might be her internal
      agitation, she knew that Lady Sarah <i>could</i> maintain the same
      countenance. Lady Sarah, who plainly discerned her mother's anxious
      curiosity, thought it her duty to keep her husband's secrets; and,
      imagining that she knew the whole truth, was not farther alarmed by these
      hints, nor did they lead her to suspect the real state of the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary was at length tolerably well satisfied, by a conversation with
      her son; during the course of which she settled in her imagination that he
      had only been inserting in his will a bequest to his friend Russell; and
      that the depression of his spirits arose from the struggle he had had in
      determining to vote against his patriotic ideas. She rose to depart; and
      Vivian, as he conducted her down stairs, and put her into her carriage,
      could scarcely repress his feelings; and he took so tender a leave of her,
      that all her apprehensions revived; but there was a cry of "<i>Lady&mdash;somebody's</i>
      carriage!" and Lady Mary's coachman drove on immediately, without giving
      her time for one word more. After his mother's departure, Vivian, instead
      of returning to the company, went to his study, and took this opportunity
      of finishing his will; but as the servants were all in attendance at
      supper he could not get any body to witness it; and for this he was
      obliged to wait till a very late hour, when all the company at last
      departed. The rattle of carriages at length died away; and when all was
      silence, just as he was about to ring for his witnesses, he heard Lady
      Sarah's step coming along the corridor towards the study: he went out
      immediately to meet her, drew her arm within his affectionately, and took
      two or three turns with her, up and down the empty saloon, whilst a
      servant was extinguishing the lights. Vivian's mind was so full that he
      could not speak; and he was scarcely conscious that he had not spoken,
      till Lady Sarah broke the silence by asking if he had finished his
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear, I have more to do yet; but you will oblige me if you will go
      to rest&mdash;you must be fatigued&mdash;mind and body."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>You</i> seem fatigued almost to death," said Lady Sarah: "and cannot
      you finish the remainder of your business as well to-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Vivian; "it must be finished before to-morrow. I am bound in
      duty to finish it before to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it is a point of duty, I have no more to say," replied Lady Sarah;
      "but," continued she, in a tone of proud humility, "but if I might so far
      intrude upon your confidence, as to inquire&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make no inquiries, my dear; for I cannot answer any, even of yours," said
      Vivian. "And let me beg of you to go to rest; my mind will then be more at
      ease. I cannot command my thoughts whilst I am anxious about you; and I am
      anxious&mdash;more anxious than ever I was in my life&mdash;about you at
      this moment. You will oblige me if you will go to rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I CANNOT rest, but I will leave you, since you desire it&mdash;I have no
      idle curiosity&mdash;Good night!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night! and thank you once more, my excellent wife, for all your
      kindness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There cannot be a better woman!" said Vivian to himself as she retired.
      "Why have I not loved her as she deserved to be loved? If I live, I will
      do my utmost to make her happy&mdash;if I live, I will yet repair all.
      And, if I die, she will have but little reason to deplore the loss of such
      a husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian now executed his will&mdash;wrote several letters of business&mdash;burnt
      letters and arranged papers&mdash;regretted that Russell, who was to be
      his executor, was not near him&mdash;made many bitter reflections on the
      past, many good resolutions for the future, in case he should survive;
      then, overpowered with fatigue of mind, slept for some time, and was
      awakened by the clock striking seven. By eight o'clock he was at the place
      appointed&mdash;Mr. Wharton appeared a few minutes afterwards. Their
      seconds having measured out the distance, they took their ground. As
      Vivian had given the challenge, Wharton had the first fire. He fired&mdash;Vivian
      staggered some paces back, fired his pistol into the air, and fell. The
      seconds ran to his assistance, and raised him from the ground. The bullet
      had entered his chest. He stretched out his hand to Mr. Wharton in token
      of forgiveness, and, as soon as he could speak, desired the seconds to
      remember that it was he who gave the challenge, and that he thought he
      deserved to bear the blame of the quarrel. Wharton, callous as he was,
      seemed struck with pity and remorse: he asked what friends Vivian would
      wish to have apprised of his situation. A surgeon was in attendance.
      Vivian, faint from loss of blood, just pronounced Russell's name, and the
      name of the hotel where he was to be found, adding "<i>nobody else</i>."
      Wharton rode off, undertaking to find Mr. Russell; and Vivian was carried
      into a little public-house, by the orders of the surgeon, who thought that
      he could not bear the motion of a carriage. Wharton met Mr. Russell, who
      was coming from town. He had come to London earlier than he had intended,
      and, in consequence of Lady Mary Vivian's note, which he had received
      immediately on his arrival, had made such inquiries as convinced him that
      her apprehensions were just; and having discovered the place where the
      parties were to meet, he had hastened thither, in hopes of preventing the
      fatal event. The moment he saw Mr. Wharton he knew that he was too late.
      Without asking any other question than, "Is Vivian alive?" he pressed
      forwards. The surgeon, who was the next person he saw, gave him no hopes
      of his friend's recovery, but said he might last till night, or linger
      perhaps for a day or two. Vivian had by this time recovered his senses and
      his speech; but when Russell entered the room where he lay, he was so much
      struck by the grief in his countenance that he could not recollect any one
      of the many things he had to say. Russell, the firm Russell, was now quite
      overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear friend," said Vivian; "this is the end of all your care&mdash;of
      all your hopes of me!&mdash;Oh, my poor, poor mother! What will become of
      her! Where can we find consolation for her!&mdash;You and Selina Sidney!
      You know how fond my mother was of her&mdash;how fond she was of my mother&mdash;till
      I, the cause of evil to all my friends, separated them. You must reunite
      them. You must repair all. This hope&mdash;this hope of your happiness, my
      beloved friend, will soothe my last moments!&mdash;&mdash;How much happier
      Selina will be with you than&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Russell sobbed aloud.&mdash;"Yes, yield to your feelings, for I know how
      strong they are," said Vivian: "you, that have always felt more for me
      than I have ever felt for myself! But it is well for you that my life
      ends; for I have never been any thing but a torment and a disgrace to you!&mdash;And
      yet I had good dispositions!&mdash;but there is no time for regret about
      myself; I have others to think of, better worth thinking of."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian called for pen, ink, and paper, had himself raised in his bed, and
      supported, whilst he wrote to Selina, and to his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not stop me," cried he to Russell; "it is the only act of friendship&mdash;the
      only thing I can do in this world now with pleasure, and let me do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      His notes contained nearly what he had just said to Russell&mdash;he put
      them open into his friend's hand; then, good-natured to the last, Vivian
      took up his pen again, with no small difficulty, and wrote a few
      affectionate words to his wife. "She <i>well</i> deserves this from me,"
      said he. "Be a friend to her, Russell&mdash;when I am gone, she will, I
      know, want consolation," After Russell had assured him that he would do
      all he desired, Vivian said, "I believe there is no one else in the world
      who will regret my death, except, perhaps, Lady Julia Lidhurst. How
      generous she was to forgive me!&mdash;Tell her, I remembered it when I was
      dying!&mdash;Weakness, weakness of mind!&mdash;the cause of all my errors!&mdash;&mdash;Oh,
      Russell! how well you knew me from the first!&mdash;But all is over now!&mdash;My
      experience can be of no use to me&mdash;Every thing swims before my eyes.&mdash;&mdash;One
      comfort is, I have not the blood of a fellow-creature to answer for. My
      greatest error was making that profligate man my friend&mdash;he was my
      ruin. I little thought, a few years ago, that I should die by his hand&mdash;but
      I forgive him, as I hope to be forgiven myself! Is the clergyman who was
      sent for come?&mdash;My dear Russell, this would be too severe a task for
      you.&mdash;He is come? Then let me see him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian was left for some time to his private devotions. The clergyman
      afterwards summoned Russell to return:&mdash;he found his friend calmed
      and resigned. Vivian stretched out his hand&mdash;thanked him once more&mdash;and
      expired!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! worthy of a better fate!" thought Russell.&mdash;"With such a heart!&mdash;With
      such talents!&mdash;And so young!&mdash;With only one fault of character!&mdash;Oh,
      my friend! is it all over?&mdash;and all in vain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian's mother and widow arrived just at this moment; and Russell and
      Lord Glistonbury, who followed breathless, could not stop them from
      entering the apartment. The mother's grief bordered on distraction; but it
      found relief in tears and cries. Lady Sarah shed no tear, and uttered no
      exclamation; but advancing, insensible of all opposition, to the bed on
      which her dead husband lay, tried whether there was any pulse, any breath
      left; then knelt down beside him in silent devotion. Lord Glistonbury,
      striking his forehead continually, and striding up and down the room,
      repeated, "I killed him!&mdash;I killed him!&mdash;I was the cause of his
      death!&mdash;My victim!&mdash;My victim!&mdash;But take her away!&mdash;Take
      <i>her</i> away&mdash;I cannot.&mdash;For mercy's sake, force her away,
      Mr. Russell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no need of force," said Lady Sarah, rising, as her father
      approached; "I am going to leave my husband for ever."&mdash;&mdash;Then,
      turning to Mr. Russell, she inquired if his friend had left any message or
      letter for her&mdash;desired to see the letter&mdash;retired with it&mdash;still
      without shedding a tear&mdash;a few hours afterwards was taken ill, and,
      before night, was delivered of a dead son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Sarah survived, but has never since appeared in what is called the
      WORLD.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
